other_servant	## Definition:\n\nA “servant” or “slave” refers to a person who works for  another person, either by choice or by force. A servant was under his master's control. In the Bible, “servant” and “slave” are mostly interchangable terms.\nThe term “serve” generally means to do work for someone, and the concept can be applied in a wide variety of contexts.\n\n* A slave was a kind of servant who was the property of the person he worked for. The person who bought a slave was called his “owner” or “master.” Some masters treated their slaves cruelly. Other masters treated their slaves well, like a valued member of the household. The term “slavery” means the state of being a slave.\n* A person could be a slave temporarily, for instance while working to repay a debt to his owner.\n* The words “young man” or “young woman” often mean “servant” or “slave.” This meaning will be discerned from context. One indicator of this situation is if the possessive is used, eg. “her young women” could be translated as “her servants” or “her slaves.”\n* The term “enslave” means “to cause to be a slave” .\n* The New Testament speaks of human beings as “slaves of sin” until Jesus frees them from its control and power. When a person receives new life in Christ, he stops being a slave to sin and becomes a slave to righteousness.\n\n## Translation Suggestions\n\n* The term “serve” can also be translated as “minister to” or “work for” or “take care of” or “obey,” depending on the context.\n* The term “enslave” could be translated as “cause to not be free” or “force to serve others” or “put under the control of others.”\n* The phrase “enslaved to” or “in bondage to” could be translated as “forced to be a slave of” or “forced to serve” or “under the control of.”\n* To “serve God” can be translated as to “worship and obey God” or to “do the work that God has commanded.”\n* In the Old Testament, God’s prophets and other people who worshiped God were often called his “servants.”\n* In the New Testament, people who obeyed God through faith in Christ were often called his “servants.”\n* To “serve tables” means to bring food to people who are sitting at tables, or more generally, to “distribute food.”\n* In the context of a person serving guests, this term means “care for” or “serve food to” or “provide food for.” When Jesus told the disciples to “serve” the fish to the people, this could be translated as, “distribute” or “hand out” or “give.”\n* People who teach others about God are said to serve both God and the ones they are teaching.\n* The apostle Paul wrote to the Corinthian Christians about how they used to “serve” the old covenant. This refers to obeying the laws of Moses. Now they “serve” the new covenant. That is, because of Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross, believers in Jesus are enabled by the Holy Spirit to please God and live holy lives.\n* Paul talks about their actions in terms of their “service” to either the old or new covenant. This could be translated as “serving” or “obeying” or “devotion to.”\n* Often, when a person referred to himself as “your servant” he was showing respect to the person addressed. That person may have had higher social status, or the speaker may be showing humility. It did not mean that the person speaking was an actual servant.\n\n\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n## Examples from the Bible stories:\n\n* ____ When Abraham was very old and his son, Isaac, had grown to be a man, Abraham sent one of his __servants__ back to the land where his relatives lived to find a wife for his son, Isaac.\n* ____ The __slave__ traders sold Joseph as a __slave__ to a wealthy government official.\n* ____ “I  will send you  to Pharaoh so that you can bring the Israelites out of their __slavery__ in Egypt.”\n* ____ Then Elijah prayed, “O Yahweh, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, show us today that you are the God of Israel and that I am your __servant__.”\n* ____ “Since the __servant__ could not pay the debt, the king said, ‘Sell this man and his family as __slaves__ to make payment on his debt.’”\n* ____ “All my father’s __servants__ have plenty to eat, and yet here I am starving.”\n* ____ The __slave__ girl kept yelling as they walked, “These men are servants of the Most High God.”\n* ____ Jesus also said, “A __servant__ is not greater than his master.”\n\n## Word Data:\n\n*  Strong’s: H0519, H5288, H5647, H5649, H5650, H5657, H7916, H8198, H8334, G12490, G14010, G14020, G23240, G34070, G34110, G36100, G38160, G49830, G52570\n*  H3547, H4929, H4931, H5647, H5656, H5673, H5975, H6213, H6399, H6402, H6440, H6633, H6635, H7272, H8104, H8120, H8199, H8278, H8334, G12470, G12480, G13980, G14020, G14380, G19830, G20640, G22120, G23230, G29990, G30000, G30090, G43370, G43420, G47540, G50870, G52560\n*  H3533, G26150

kt_jesus	## Facts:\n\nJesus is God’s Son. The name “Jesus” means “Yahweh saves.” The term “Christ” is a title that means “anointed one” and is another word for Messiah.\n\n* The two names are often combined as “Jesus Christ” or “Christ Jesus.” These names emphasize that God’s Son is the Messiah, who came to save people from being punished eternally for their sins.\n* In a miraculous way, the Holy Spirit caused the eternal Son of God to be born as a human being. His mother was told by an angel to call him “Jesus” because he was destined to save people from their sins.\n* Jesus did many miracles that revealed that he is God and that he is the Christ, or the Messiah.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* In many languages “Jesus” and “Christ” are spelled in a way that keeps the sounds or spelling as close to the original as possible. For example, “Jesucristo,” “Jezus Christus,” “Yesus Kristus”, and “Hesukristo” are some of the ways that these names are translated into different languages.\n* For the term “Christ,” some translators may prefer to use only some form of the term “Messiah” throughout.\n* Also consider how these names are spelled in a nearby local or national language.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n## Examples from the Bible stories:\n\n* ____ The angel said, “You will become pregnant and give birth to a son.

kt_saint	## Definition:\n\nThe term “saints” literally means “holy ones” and refers to believers in Jesus.\n\n* Later in church history, a person known for his good works was given the title “saint,” but that was not how this term was used during New Testament times.\n* Believers in Jesus are saints or holy ones, not because of what they have done, but rather because of their faith in the saving work of Jesus Christ. He is the one who makes them holy.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* Ways to translate “saints” could include “holy ones” or “holy people” or “holy believers in Jesus” or “set apart ones.”\n* Be careful not to use a term that refers to people of only one Christian group.\n\n\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s: H2623, H6918, H6922, G00400

For example, “share in Christ” means to “share in” the benefits that come from knowing Christ. To “glory in” Christ means to be glad and give praise to God for who Jesus is and what he has done. To “believe in” Christ means to trust him as Savior and know him.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* Depending on the context, different ways to translate “in Christ” and “in the Lord”  could include:\n\n    * “who belong to Christ”\n    * “because you believe in Christ”\n    * “because Christ has saved us”\n    * “in service to the Lord”\n    * “relying on the Lord”\n    * “because of what the Lord has done.”\n\n* People who “believe in” Christ or who “have faith in” Christ believe what Jesus taught and are trusting him to save them because of his sacrifice on the cross that paid the penalty for their sins. Some languages may have one word that translates verbs like “believe in” or “share in” or “trust in.”\n\n\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s: G15190, G29620, G55470

kt_lord	## Definition:\n\nIn the Bible, the term “lord” generally refers to someone who has ownership or authority over other people. In the Bible, however, the term is used to address many different kinds of people, including God.\n\n* This word is sometimes translated as “master” when addressing Jesus or when referring to someone who owns slaves.\n* Some English versions translate this as “sir” in contexts where someone is politely addressing someone of higher status.\n\nWhen “Lord” is capitalized, it is a title that refers to God. \n\n* In the Old Testament, this term is also used in expressions such as “Lord God Almighty” or “Lord Yahweh” or “Yahweh our Lord.”\n* In the New Testament, the apostles used this term in expressions such as “Lord Jesus” and “Lord Jesus Christ,” which communicate that Jesus is God.\n* The term “Lord” in the New Testament is also used alone as a direct reference to God, especially in quotations from the Old Testament. For example, the Old Testament text has “Blessed is he who comes in the name of Yahweh” and the New Testament text has “Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.”\n* In the ULT and UST, the title “Lord” is only used to translate the actual Hebrew and Greek words that mean “Lord.” It is never used as a translation of God’s name , as is done in many translations.\n\n* Some languages translate “Lord” as “Master” or “Ruler” or some other term that communicates ownership or supreme rule.\n* In the appropriate contexts, many translations capitalize the first letter of this term to make it clear to the reader that this is a title referring to God.\n* For places in the New Testament where there is a quote from the Old Testament, the term “Lord God” could be used to make it clear that this is a reference to God.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* This term can be translated with the equivalent of “master” when it refers to a person who owns slaves. It can also be used by a servant to address the person he works for.\n* When it refers to Jesus, if the context shows that the speaker sees him as a religious teacher, it can be translated with a respectful address for a religious teacher, such as “master.”\n* If the person addressing Jesus does not know him, “lord” could be translated with a respectful form of address such as “sir.” This translation would also be used for other contexts in which a polite form of address to a man is called for.\n* When referring to God the Father or to Jesus, this term is considered a title, written as “Lord”  in English.\n\n\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n## Examples from the Bible stories:\n\n* ____ But Jesus replied to Satan by quoting from the Scriptures.

God’s personal name is “Yahweh.”\n\n* God has always existed; he existed before anything else existed, and he will continue to exist forever.\n* He is the only true God and has authority over everything in the universe.\n* God is perfectly righteous, infinitely wise, holy, sinless, just, merciful, and loving.\n* He is a covenant-keeping God, who always fulfills his promises.\n* People were created to worship God and he is the only one they should worship.\n* God revealed his name as “Yahweh,” which means “he is” or “I am” or “the One who  exists.”\n* The Bible also teaches about false “gods,” which are nonliving idols that people wrongly worship.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* Ways to translate “God” could include “Deity” or “Creator” or “Supreme Being” or “Supreme Creator” or “Infinite Sovereign Lord” or “Eternal Supreme Being.”\n* Consider how God is referred to in a local or national language.

The word “ransom” also refers to this practice.\n* If someone’s land had been sold, a relative of that person could “redeem” or “buy back” that land so that it would stay in the family.\n* These practices show how God redeems people who are in slavery to sin.

People who have been redeemed by God are set free from sin and its punishment.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* Depending on the context, the term “redeem” could also be translated as “buy back” or “pay to free ” or “ransom.”\n* The term “redemption” could be translated as “ransom” or “freedom payment” or “buying back.”\n* The words “ransom” and “redeem” have basically the same meaning, so some languages may have only one term to translate both these words. The word “ransom,” however, can also mean the payment necessary to “redeem” something or someone. The term “redeem” never refers to the actual payment itself.\n\n, \n\n## Bible References:\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s: H1350, H1353, H6299, H6302, H6304, H6306, H6561, H7069, G00590, G06290, G18050, G30840, G30850

Something that was “unlawful” was “not permitted” by those laws.\n* To do something “lawfully” means to do it “properly” or “in the right way.”\n* Many of the things that the Jewish laws considered lawful or not lawful were not in agreement with God’s laws about loving others.\n* Depending on the context, ways to translate “lawful” could include “permitted” or “according to God’s law” or “following our laws” or “proper” or “fitting.”\n* The phrase “Is it lawful?” could also be translated as “Do our laws allow?” or “Is that something our laws permit?”\n\nThe terms “unlawful” and “not lawful” are used to describe actions that break a law.\n\n* In the New Testament, the term “unlawful” is not only used to refer to breaking God’s laws, but also often refers to breaking Jewish man-made laws.\n* Over the years, the Jews added to the laws that God gave to them. The Jewish leaders would call something “unlawful” if it did not conform to their man-made laws.\n* When Jesus and his disciples were picking grain on a Sabbath day, the Pharisees accused them of doing something “unlawful” because it was breaking the Jewish laws about not working on that day.\n* When Peter stated that eating unclean foods was “unlawful” for him, he meant that if he ate those foods he would be breaking the laws God had given the Israelites about not eating certain foods.\n\nThe term “lawless” describes a person who does not obey laws or rules. When a country or group of people are in a state of “lawlessness,” there is widespread disobedience, rebellion, or immorality.\n\n* A lawless person is rebellious and does not obey God’s laws.\n* The apostle Paul wrote that in the last days there will be a “man of lawlessness,” or a “lawless one,” who will be influenced by Satan to do evil things.\n\n## Translation Suggestions:\n\n* This term “unlawful” should be translated using a word or expression that means “not lawful” or “lawbreaking.”\n* Other ways to translate “unlawful” could be “not permitted” or “not according to God’s law” or “not conforming to our laws.”\n* The expression “against the law” has the same meaning as “unlawful.”\n\n* The term “lawless” could also be translated as “rebellious” or “disobedient” or “law-defying”.\n* The term “lawlessness” could be translated as “not obeying any laws” or “rebellion .”\n* The phrase “man of lawlessness” could be translated as “man who does not obey any laws” or “man who rebels against God’s laws.”\n* It is important to keep the concept of “law” in this term, if possible.\n* Note that the term “unlawful” has a different meaning from this term.\n\n\n\n## Bible References:\n\n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n## Word Data:\n\n* Strong’s: H6530, G01110, G01130, G02660, G04580, G04590, G18320, G35450
