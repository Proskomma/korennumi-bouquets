TIT 1:1	TIT 1:4	idm162665	 The opening of Titus, like that of 1 Timothy (*1 Tim 1:1-2*), establishes Paul’s authority for his delegate.\n\n
TIT 1:1	TIT 1:1	idm162672	 **and to teach . . . godly lives:** See *2:11-14*; *1 Tim 6:3*.\n\n
TIT 1:2	TIT 1:2	idm162681	 The **confidence that they have eternal life** enables God’s people to live in the present in light of the future (see *2:11-14*; *3:7-8*). • **God—who does not lie:** The true God contrasts with popular Cretan conceptions (see *study note on 1:12*). This statement also underlines God’s plan of salvation as unchanging (*1:1*): God can be trusted to fulfill his promises (see *Num 23:19*; *1 Sam 15:29*; *Rom 3:3-4*).\n\n
TIT 1:3	TIT 1:3	idm162696	 **at just the right time:** The initiative is entirely with God, who carries out his plan on his own timetable by his own will (see *3:5*; *1 Tim 2:6*; *2 Tim 1:10*). • **God our Savior:** In *Titus 1:4*, Jesus is also called “our Savior,” identifying Jesus with God (see *2:10*, *13*; *3:4*, *6*).\n\n
TIT 1:4	TIT 1:4	idm162712	 **Titus** was Paul’s delegate in dealing with the church in Crete. • **my true son:** The wording authorizes the delegate (as in *1 Tim 1:2*).\n\n
TIT 1:5	TIT 1:16	idm162721	 Strong, faithful leadership was needed in the churches of Crete to address the danger of false teachers (*1:10-16*). This part of Titus’s task dovetails with the larger concern of the letter: to shape a community that bears witness to Christ by embodying God’s grace in its conduct. Cp. *1 Tim 3:1-7*.\n\n
TIT 1:5	TIT 1:9	idm162729	 Titus was directed to appoint leaders in order to **complete our work there**—i.e., to establish the church (cp. *1 Tim 3:1-13*). Deacons are not mentioned, possibly because these were new, small churches. • These leadership qualities might be an accommodation to the newness of these converts and the roughness of their culture. It is assumed that the elders will be male (see *1 Tim 3:4-5*).\n\n
TIT 1:5	TIT 1:5	idm162738	 **Crete** was located in the Mediterranean, south of the Aegean Sea. It was an important location for travel and trade by sea, so it had a mix of influences, including a Jewish population. Some from Crete had been at Pentecost (*Acts 2:11*), but this letter seems to deal with an infant church. • **elders in each town:** There may have been more than one house church in a given town and possibly more than one elder in a given house church. Clearly, there were churches in at least two towns and the leadership was specific to each town.\n\n
TIT 1:6	TIT 1:6	idm162747	 **must be faithful to his wife:** See *study note on 1 Tim 3:2*. • **wild or rebellious:** This probably reflects Cretan culture with its low moral standards (*Titus 1:12*).\n\n
TIT 1:7	TIT 1:7	idm162757	 **A church leader** (or *An overseer,* or *A bishop*) **is a manager of God’s household:** See *1:11*; *2:2-10*; *1 Tim 1:4*; *3:4-5*, *12*, *15*; *2 Tim 2:20-21*. • These qualities indicate that an elder should not be running with the Cretan masses (see *Titus 1:12*).\n\n
TIT 1:9	TIT 1:9	idm162775	 The elders had a leading role in teaching the community. This may have been necessary in dealing with the immediate threat to these particular communities (as also in Ephesus; see *1 Tim 3:1*). • Only with **a strong belief** in the Good News would an elder **be able to** provide **wholesome teaching**. Paul’s specific concerns are addressed in *Titus 2:1–3:11*, in light of the problems mentioned in *1:10-16* and *3:9-11* (see also *1 Tim 1:10*). • Titus had a similar role (cp. *Titus 1:13*; *2:15*; *3:10-11*). The local leadership would carry on where Paul and his delegates left off. • **Those who oppose it** are described in *1:10-16*.\n\n
TIT 1:10	TIT 1:16	idm162794	 In a native population of troublemakers, Titus would need to exercise a firm hand to rid these Christian communities of corruption and make them healthy in the faith (*1:13-16*).\n\n
TIT 1:10	TIT 1:10	idm162801	 **rebellious people:** The same Greek word is used of children in *1:6*. • **those who insist on circumcision for salvation** (literally *those of the circumcision*): This probably refers to Jewish Christians; the Greek phrase leaves open whether or not they required circumcision of Gentiles. The Jewish flavor of this false teaching is suggested in *1:14-15* and *3:9*.\n\n
TIT 1:11	TIT 1:11	idm162813	 **turning whole families away:** This also happened in Ephesus (cp. *1 Tim 4:3*; *2 Tim 2:18*; *3:6*). • **only for money:** Elders must not have this characteristic (*Titus 1:7*; see also *1 Tim 6:5-10*; *2 Cor 2:17*; *1 Pet 5:2*).\n\n
TIT 1:12	TIT 1:12	idm162828	 **one of their own men, a prophet from Crete, has said:** This quotation is from Epimenides of Knossos, a philosopher who lived on Crete around the 500s BC. • **all liars:** This charge was directed specifically at the Cretan claim to have Zeus’s tomb on the island. According to Cretan mythology, the god Zeus was once a mere human who lived and died on Crete (his tomb was said to be there) but who had achieved godhood through his patronage (i.e., gifts and benefits) to humans. Some Greek moralists opposed this legend and characterized it as a lie. A quote from Alexandria in the 200s BC reads: “Cretans are always liars. For a tomb, O Lord, Cretans build for you; but you do not die, for you are forever.” One of Crete’s own prophets (Epimenides) had the same assessment, and Paul cites his voice of conscience approvingly (*1:13*; see *Acts 17:28*), for the God who does not lie (*Titus 1:2*) stands in opposition to the lies of such myths. • **liars . . . animals . . . gluttons:** It was believed that Cretan immorality resulted from their belief about Zeus; religious lies had given rise to moral corruption. Paul later counters these vices by presenting the contrasting virtues (*2:12*). He calls the Cretans to reach ethical ideals that are extolled in human society generally but were absent on Crete, as bemoaned by their own prophet. They would reach these ideals only through the gospel of Jesus Christ (*2:11-14*). • **lazy gluttons:** Cretans were known to do anything for a little cash. They were famous as mercenaries and as insatiate consumers. They reputedly saw no shame in greed (see *Phil 3:19*). • Paul applies the quotation more directly to the current false teachers than to Cretan culture generally; the false teachers carried on this Cretan tradition of immorality built on falsehood.\n\n
TIT 1:13	TIT 1:13	idm162846	 **This is true:** See *study note on 1:12*. • Being **strong in the faith** is here defined as rejecting false teachings (cp. *1:9*).\n\n
TIT 1:14	TIT 1:14	idm162856	 **Jewish myths:** See *3:9*; *1 Tim 1:4*; *4:7*; *2 Tim 4:4*. • **have turned away from the truth:** This was apostasy, not mere unbelief. See *1 Tim 1:6-7*.\n\n
TIT 1:15	TIT 1:16	idm162869	 These two verses comment on the people of *1:14* and their commands, while transitioning to a discussion of wholesome teaching (*2:1–3:11*).\n\n
TIT 1:15	TIT 1:15	idm162877	 Cp. *1 Tim 4:3-5*.\n\n
TIT 1:16	TIT 1:16	idm162884	 Sound teaching and godliness are always linked together in the letters to Timothy and Titus (see *1 Tim 1:7-11*; *3:15-16*; *5:24-25*; *2 Tim 3:5*, *9*). Similarly, the ungodly **way they live** is connected with false teaching. • **anything good:** This contrasts with *Titus 3:1*.\n\n
TIT 2:1	TIT 2:15	idm162898	 **Wholesome teaching** was especially urgent on account of the false teachers, who had wreaked havoc on “whole families” (*1:11*). In *2:1-10*, Paul addresses different groups within the household of faith, showing his concern for the public testimony of the church (*2:5*, *8*, *10*; see also *1 Tim 5:1–6:2*). Paul then elaborates on the coming of Christ (*Titus 2:11-14*) before giving a direct charge to Titus (*2:15*).\n\n
TIT 2:9	TIT 2:10	idm162913	 The purpose of these commands is to **make the teaching about God** . . . **attractive** (see *1 Tim 6:1-2*).\n\n
TIT 2:11	TIT 2:15	idm162922	 **For:** The commands of *2:1-10* are here grounded in the past and future coming of Christ. God’s grace is a model for the church’s own conduct, even as salvation by grace makes a good life possible and creates people devoted to good works (see also *3:3-7*).\n\n
TIT 2:11	TIT 2:11	idm162931	 **has been revealed** (literally *has appeared*): See *study note on 1 Tim 6:14*. • **salvation to all people:** Paul intends that God’s grace will fully accomplish its ends among the Cretans and that, in doing so, it will enlist them into God’s saving work of evangelism (*Titus 2:12*; see *1 Tim 2:1-7*; *4:10*).\n\n
TIT 2:12	TIT 2:12	idm162944	 **we are instructed:** The emphasis of this instruction falls on the positive virtues: **wisdom, righteousness, and devotion to God**. In Greco-Roman writings, these three virtues represent virtuous conduct in general. These virtues counter the Cretan vices listed in *1:12* and are transformed into thoroughly Christian qualities (see *2:13*). • Paul exhorts the Cretans to bring these virtues to life, in order to make plain to their compatriots that a virtuous life derives only from God’s grace in Jesus Christ.\n\n
TIT 2:13	TIT 2:13	idm162954	 **we look forward:** This implies **hope** as well as future accountability, both of which stimulate godly conduct in the present. • **will be revealed:** This phrase translates a prominent Greek word in the letters to Timothy and Titus (“epiphany” or “appearing”; also *2:11*; see *study note on 1 Tim 6:14*). • **great God and Savior:** This is one of the few places in the New Testament where Jesus Christ is called “God” outright (see also *John 1:1*; *20:28*; *Rom 9:5*; *Heb 1:8*; *2 Pet 1:1*; possibly *John 1:18*). Yet this claim is entirely consistent with the roles and attributes of Christ and the worship that he receives. Possibly this designation is used here to insist that Christ is not a mere human promoted to membership in the pantheon of gods (see *study note on Titus 1:12*). At the time of this letter, Christians were insisting more and more that Christ alone, rather than rulers and emperors, should be called divine.\n\n
TIT 2:14	TIT 2:14	idm162973	 Salvation produces a people who have the desire and capacity for the good deeds outlined in *2:2-10*. • **He gave his life:** See also *1 Tim 2:6*. • **to free us:** See *Gal 3:22*; *4:4-5*; cp. *Exod 6:6-8*. • The phrase **his very own people** recalls the formation of Israel as a nation (see *Exod 19:5*; *Deut 7:6*; *14:2*). Those who follow Christ are now God’s people—his nation—and the Spirit leads them to keep God’s covenant. • **totally committed to doing good deeds:** See *Titus 1:16*; *Eph 2:10*.\n\n
TIT 3:1	TIT 3:11	idm162993	 The emphasis on wholesome teaching (*1:9*; *2:1*) continues; Paul turns now to the relationship of the Christian community with society at large (cp. *1 Tim 2:2-4*). As in *Titus 2:1-15*, God’s instructions for his people (*3:1-2*) are based on his dealings with them (*3:3-7*; cp. *study note on 2:11-15*). Paul then instructs Titus to avoid fruitless disputes and to insist on beneficial teaching (*3:8-11*).\n\n
TIT 3:1	TIT 3:1	idm163007	 Paul might be telling **the believers** to make a clear distinction between themselves and the unruly common masses. Alternatively, the troublemakers (*1:10-15*; *3:10*) might have adopted unruly behaviors that stemmed from their erroneous teachings (as is likely the case in *1 Tim 2:1-7*). • On relations to **government** . . . **officers***,* see *1 Tim 2:2*; *Rom 13:1-7*.\n\n
TIT 3:3	TIT 3:3	idm163022	 Humility (*3:2*) is fitting, considering our state when God’s kindness and love came to us (*3:4*; see *Eph 2:1-4*; *5:8*; *Col 3:7*; *1 Pet 4:3*).\n\n
TIT 3:4	TIT 3:7	idm163034	 This passage might be a summary or quote from traditional teaching (see *1 Tim 1:15*; *2:5-6*).\n\n
TIT 3:4	TIT 3:4	idm163042	 We should behave toward our compatriots as God acted toward us—in **kindness and love**. God’s salvation makes this possible. • **revealed** (literally *appeared*): The Greek word relates to the coming of Christ (also in *2:11*, *13*; see *study note on 1 Tim 6:14*).\n\n
TIT 3:5	TIT 3:5	idm163054	 **not because . . . but because:** The contrast is between human actions that might be thought to merit salvation and God’s grace (see *Gal 2:16*). Salvation is through faith in God’s **mercy** alone (*Eph 2:8*). • **He washed away our sins, giving us a new birth:** See *Ezek 16:9*; *John 3:1-15*; *Eph 5:26*; *Heb 10:22*; *2 Pet 1:9*. • **and new life through the Holy Spirit:** This signifies a complete departure from the life of sin and death and a transfer into the realm of life and purity (see also *Rom 12:2*; *2 Cor 5:17*; *Col 3:10*).\n\n
TIT 3:7	TIT 3:7	idm163074	 The first half of this verse sums up *3:4-6*. The second half supplies the purpose for what God did. • **made us right in his sight:** See *Rom 3:20-28*; *Gal 2:16-17*. • **inherit eternal life:** The Spirit (*Titus 3:5*) is often linked with our status as heirs (see *Rom 8:15-17*; *1 Cor 6:9-11*; *Gal 4:6-7*; *Eph 1:13-14*).\n\n
TIT 3:8	TIT 3:8	idm163090	 The **trustworthy saying** is *3:4-7* (cp. *1 Tim 1:15*).\n\n
TIT 3:10	TIT 3:11	idm163099	 **have nothing more to do with . . . people like that:** This refers to incorrigibly quarrelsome and divisive people (see *1:11*, *13*).\n\n
TIT 3:12	TIT 3:15	idm163108	 The letter closes with news (*3:12*), a final exhortation (*3:13-14*), greetings, and a blessing (*3:15*).\n\n
TIT 3:12	TIT 3:12	idm163117	 Evidently **Artemas or Tychicus** would be Titus’s replacement on Crete. Since Tychicus was in fact sent to Ephesus (see *2 Tim 4:12*), Artemas might have been the one who went to Crete. • **Nicopolis:** Several cities had this name; this was most likely a major city on the western coast of the Greek peninsula. Paul had possibly worked here before (see *Rom 15:19*, which mentions Paul’s activity even further west).\n\n
TIT 3:13	TIT 3:13	idm163127	 **Zenas** and **Apollos** were involved in spreading the Good News, and they might have been the couriers of this letter to Titus. • **Zenas** was probably an expert in Roman law or a Roman jurist (the same word for **lawyer** is in *Luke 7:30*; *10:25*); his pagan name (“gift of Zeus”) makes it unlikely that he was an expert in Jewish law. • **Apollos** is presumably the same man as in *Acts 18:24*; *19:1*; *1 Cor 1:12*; *3:4-6*, *22*; *4:6*; *16:12*. • **everything they need:** See *1 Tim 3:2*; *3 Jn 1:5-8*; cp. *Rom 15:24*; *1 Cor 16:6*, *11*; *2 Cor 1:16*.\n\n
TIT 3:14	TIT 3:14	idm163154	 This final exhortation is connected to the responsibility to take care of Zenas and Apollos (see *Rom 12:13*; *Eph 4:28*; *1 Thes 4:11*; *1 Tim 5:8*, *16*; *6:18*). • **Our people must** involve themselves in the life-giving ministry of the Good News rather than in the **unproductive** speculations of the false teachers.\n\n
TIT 3:15	TIT 3:15	idm163168	 **you all:** The letter was addressed to Titus (*1:4*), but the whole church was the audience for the letter.\n\n
