PHP 1:1	PHP 1:2	idm157419	 Paul introduces his letter by listing the names of the senders and recipients of the letter, then giving an invocation of grace and peace.\n\n
PHP 1:1	PHP 1:1	idm157425	 **Timothy** was one of Paul’s most trusted co-workers and messengers. He is listed as co-sender, as he is for five other letters (2 Cor, Col, 1 Thes, 2 Thes, Phlm). • **slaves of Christ Jesus:** As those who belong entirely to Christ, they were completely devoted to his service (see *Phil 2:20-21*). • **God’s holy people** have been made holy in God’s sight by Christ’s redeeming work (see *Eph 1:4*, *7*; *5:25-27*; *Col 1:22*), and they are being sanctified by the transforming work of the Holy Spirit in their lives (cp. *Phil 4:21*). • **Philippi** was a Roman colony in the province of Macedonia. The church in Philippi was the first Christian community in Greece (see *Acts 16:11-40*). • In the early church, **church leaders** provided spiritual leadership, while **deacons** attended to practical matters (see *1 Tim 3:1-13*). There were no professional pastors or priests as there are today (cp. *1 Cor 14:26-31*).\n\n
PHP 1:2	PHP 1:2	idm157446	 **Grace** is undeserved blessing that comes from God; **peace** is well-being and contentedness rooted in the Good News and brought about by the Holy Spirit (see *Gal 5:22*). These qualities are gifts from **God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ** (see *Rom 5:1-2*).\n\n
PHP 1:3	PHP 1:11	idm157457	 Following his usual practice, Paul thanks God for the recipients and prays for them.\n\n
PHP 1:4	PHP 1:6	idm157463	 Paul’s **joy** derived from how the Philippians had joined him as **partners in spreading the Good News** and from his confidence that God would **continue** his **good work** in them.\n\n
PHP 1:5	PHP 1:5	idm157473	 Their partnership included financial support (see *4:10-20*).\n\n
PHP 1:6	PHP 1:6	idm157480	 **God, who began the good work within you:** God takes the initiative to work his salvation in people (see *Rom 9:16*; *Eph 1:3-8*, *11*; *2:4-10*), so he can be trusted to **continue his work** of changing people into the likeness of his Son (see *Rom 8:29*; *Eph 4:13*, *15*).\n\n
PHP 1:7	PHP 1:7	idm157495	 **You share with me the special favor of God:** Perhaps their lives were blessed because of Paul’s suffering and witness; perhaps they had suffered together with him (see *1:29*).\n\n
PHP 1:9	PHP 1:10	idm157503	 **Love** is a fruit of Christ’s Spirit within believers (*Rom 5:5*; *Gal 5:22*). • **growing in knowledge and understanding:** In this way, believers can understand **what really matters** (see *Rom 12:2*) and **live pure and blameless lives until the day of Christ’s return** (cp. *1 Thes 3:12-13*; *5:23*).\n\n
PHP 1:11	PHP 1:11	idm157518	 **Righteous character** cannot be produced by human effort; it comes only through the Spirit of Christ working in people’s hearts. • **Glory and praise to God** is the ultimate purpose for which God’s people live (see *Eph 1:6*, *12*, *14*).\n\n
PHP 1:12	PHP 1:19	idm157529	 Paul rejoiced that his imprisonment had resulted in the spread of the Good News.\n\n
PHP 1:12	PHP 1:12	idm157535	 **my dear brothers and sisters:** Greek adelphoi, a generic term commonly used to address members of the same family, both male and female. • **Everything that has happened to me here** refers to Paul’s imprisonment. • **has helped to spread the Good News:** See *Acts 28:17-31* for an example of this.\n\n
PHP 1:13	PHP 1:13	idm157546	 **The whole palace guard** were workers in the emperor’s or provincial governor’s official residence (see *4:22*). • Paul was in prison **because of Christ**—that is, because of preaching the Good News of Christ (cp. *Acts 21:26–28:31*).\n\n
PHP 1:14	PHP 1:14	idm157556	 As a result of Paul’s courage and boldness, **the believers** (literally *the brothers in the Lord;* see *study note on 1:12*) had become more daring and less fearful in proclaiming **God’s message**. Paul’s boldness was contagious.\n\n
PHP 1:15	PHP 1:18	idm157566	 **some are preaching out of jealousy and rivalry:** They evidently were believers who were critical of Paul (cp. *2 Cor 10–13*; *Gal 4:12-20*; *5:7-12*). Even so, the message about Christ was being preached, so Paul rejoiced.\n\n
PHP 1:19	PHP 1:19	idm157576	 **this will lead to my deliverance:** Paul expected to be released from prison soon (see *1:25-26*; *2:24*; contrast *2 Tim 4:6*, written from prison at a later time when Paul expected death).\n\n
PHP 1:21	PHP 1:21	idm157586	 **dying is even better:** For believers, death holds no fear, as death leads directly into the presence of Christ (see *1:23*; cp. *John 5:24*; *11:25-26*; *Rom 8:38-39*).\n\n
PHP 1:23	PHP 1:23	idm157597	 **I long to go and be with Christ:** Death leads believers immediately into the Lord’s presence (cp. *3:20-21*; *1 Cor 15:20-23*, *51-52*; *2 Cor 5:1-8*; *1 Thes 4:13-17*).\n\n
PHP 1:25	PHP 1:25	idm157609	 The well-being of the church is more important to Paul than his own desire to be with Christ. • **experience the joy of your faith:** Believers are encouraged to find joy even in the midst of suffering (see *4:4*; *John 15:11*, *20*; *16:20-24*; *1 Thes 5:16*).\n\n
PHP 1:27	PHP 1:30	idm157621	 Paul encourages the Philippian Christians to live in a way that is **worthy of the Good News** (cp. *Eph 4:1*; *Col 1:10*; *1 Thes 2:12*), particularly by standing strong despite persecution.\n\n
PHP 1:27	PHP 1:27	idm157631	 As foreigners in this world, the Philippian believers are to **live as citizens of heaven** (cp. *3:20*; *1 Pet 2:9-11*).\n\n
PHP 1:28	PHP 1:28	idm157640	 **a sign to them that they are going to be destroyed, but that you are going to be saved:** As translated, the persecutors would be convicted by the Philippians’ example. The same Greek phrase could also be translated *a sign to them that you are going to be destroyed, but a sign to you that you are going to be saved.* By that interpretation, the persecutors would remain blind to the truth (cp. *2 Cor 2:15-16*).\n\n
PHP 1:29	PHP 1:29	idm157649	 **the privilege of suffering:** What the world considers dishonorable, Christians consider an honor because it is **for him**—it honors Christ.\n\n
PHP 1:30	PHP 1:30	idm157657	 **We are in this struggle together:** Both Paul and the Philippians faced strong opposition—Paul was in prison, and the Philippians were being persecuted. • **You have seen my struggle in the past:** See *Acts 16:11-40*; cp. *1 Thes 2:2*.\n\n
PHP 2:1	PHP 2:11	idm157667	 In the midst of their persecution, Paul encourages the Philippians to be united and to live a humble life like Christ.\n\n
PHP 2:1	PHP 2:2	idm157673	 **Is there . . . ?** These rhetorical questions expect positive answers. Those who have a real experience of Christ should live together in harmony and **love**.\n\n
PHP 2:3	PHP 2:4	idm157681	 **Don’t be selfish:** Self-centeredness is antithetical to genuine care for others (cp. *2:20-21*; *1 Cor 10:24*; *Gal 5:26*).\n\n
PHP 2:6	PHP 2:11	idm157691	 This early Christian hymn is about Christ’s preexistence and divine nature, incarnation and death, exaltation and lordship.\n\n
PHP 2:6	PHP 2:6	idm157697	 **Though he was God:** See *John 1:1-3*; *17:5*; *Col 1:15*.\n\n
PHP 2:7	PHP 2:7	idm157707	 **he gave up his divine privileges** (literally *he emptied himself*): The rest of *2:7-8* explains this ultimate expression of divine self-denial (cp. *2 Cor 8:9*). • **the humble position of a slave** (or *the form of a slave*): Paul might have been thinking of *Isa 52:13–53:12*. • **and was born as a human:** See *John 1:14*; *1 Tim 3:16*.\n\n
PHP 2:8	PHP 2:8	idm157723	 **in obedience to God:** It was God’s will that Jesus die for the sins of humanity (see *Isa 53:7*; *Matt 26:39*; *John 3:16*; *10:17-18*; *Rom 5:8*, *19*; *8:3*; *Heb 5:8*; *1 Jn 4:9-10*, *14*). • **a criminal’s death on a cross:** In the Roman Empire, crucifixion was a cruel and humiliating punishment for criminals.\n\n
PHP 2:9	PHP 2:9	idm157741	 As a result of Christ’s humble obedience, **God elevated him to the place of highest honor***;* see *Acts 1:9-10*; cp. *Acts 2:32-33*; *7:55-56*. • **the name above all other names:** Jesus has supreme authority and power (*Phil 2:10-11*; cp. *Matt 28:18*; *John 17:5*; *Acts 2:33-36*; *Heb 2:9*; *12:2*).\n\n
PHP 2:10	PHP 2:11	idm157759	 The entire creation, including spiritual powers and angels, humans on **earth***,* and those who have died, will one day acknowledge the authority of **Jesus Christ** as **Lord** (see *Eph 1:9-10*, *21*; *Col 1:20-25*; *1 Pet 3:22*). • **every tongue declare** (cp. *Isa 45:23*; *Rom 14:11*): This does not imply universal salvation, because not all will confess him as Lord freely out of love and devotion. • **Lord***,* a divine title representing the Old Testament name Yahweh, is frequently applied to Jesus in the New Testament.\n\n
PHP 2:12	PHP 2:18	idm157778	 Paul encourages believers to remain firm in their faith and to live faithful, obedient, and pure lives modeled after Christ.\n\n
PHP 2:12	PHP 2:12	idm157784	 **obeying God** (see *John 3:36*; *Rom 1:5*): Believers must reckon with God’s judgment like everyone else (cp. *1 Cor 3:10-13*), so they must live before him obediently, **with deep reverence and fear**.\n\n
PHP 2:13	PHP 2:13	idm157795	 **For God is working in you:** God empowers and energizes believers’ lives (see *John 15:5*; *1 Cor 12:6*; *15:10*; *2 Cor 3:5*; *1 Thes 2:13*). Both **the desire and the power to do what pleases him** come from God.\n\n
PHP 2:14	PHP 2:14	idm157808	 **Complaining and arguing** arise from self-centeredness (see *1 Cor 10:10*; *1 Pet 4:9*; *Jude 1:16*), whereas believers are called to sacrificial love (*Phil 2:4*).\n\n
PHP 2:15	PHP 2:15	idm157819	 **shining like bright lights:** Believers are to draw people to God by their lives (see *Matt 5:13-16*). • **in a world full of crooked and perverse people:** See *Deut 32:5*; *Rom 1:18-32*; *3:10-23*.\n\n
PHP 2:16	PHP 2:16	idm157831	 **Hold firmly to the word of life:** Believers must maintain their faith in Christ’s life-giving Good News. God is faithful, but they, too, must remain faithful (*1:6*; *2:12-13*). • **run the race:** Paul frequently uses athletic language as a metaphor for the Christian life (see *3:12-14*; *1 Cor 9:24*, *26*; *Gal 2:2*; *5:7*; *2 Tim 4:7*).\n\n
PHP 2:17	PHP 2:18	idm157847	 **I will rejoice even if I lose my life, pouring it out like a liquid offering to God:** Both Jews and pagans often poured out a libation of wine either on a sacrifice or at the base of the altar in honor of the deity. Paul’s entire life was an offering to God (cp. *Rom 12:1*; *15:16*). • **Faithful service** is a cause for rejoicing, because nothing done for God is in vain (see *1 Cor 15:58*).\n\n
PHP 2:19	PHP 2:24	idm157858	 Paul commends **Timothy***,* whom he hopes to send to the Philippians in the near future. Timothy had accompanied Paul on his first trip to Philippi (see *Acts 16:1-3*, *12*; *17:15*; *18:5*; cp. *Acts 19:22*). Timothy stood out as a person whose whole life was sacrificially devoted to **what matters to Jesus Christ** and to the **welfare** of his people.\n\n
PHP 2:23	PHP 2:23	idm157873	 **What is going to happen to me here** possibly refers to the outcome of Paul’s trial.\n\n
PHP 2:24	PHP 2:24	idm157880	 Paul had **confidence** that he would soon be freed from prison and be able to visit the Philippians (see *1:19*, *25-26*).\n\n
PHP 2:25	PHP 2:30	idm157889	 Paul commends **Epaphroditus** (see also *4:18*), a messenger from the church at Philippi whom he was now sending back to them, perhaps carrying this letter. • The description **fellow soldier** suggests the difficulties, opposition, and dangers encountered in Christ’s work.\n\n
PHP 2:27	PHP 2:27	idm157898	 Epaphroditus’s recovery from a nearly fatal illness is attributed to God’s **mercy***,* both on Epaphroditus and on Paul, who was already suffering in prison.\n\n
PHP 2:29	PHP 2:30	idm157906	 Epaphroditus deserved their **honor***,* for **he risked his life** for Christ on their behalf (for the importance of showing honor, cp. *Rom 10:12*; *13:7*; *Eph 5:33*; *6:2*; *1 Tim 5:17*; *6:1*; *1 Pet 2:17*; *3:7*).\n\n
PHP 3:1	PHP 3:1	idm157923	 **rejoice in the Lord:** This theme is resumed in *4:4* (see also *1:18*; *2:17-18*, *28*; *4:10*). • The phrase **these things** (literally *the same things*) is ambiguous: it may refer to (1) the immediately preceding encouragement to **rejoice in the Lord**; (2) the earlier encouragement to follow Christ’s example (*2:1-18*); (3) Paul’s exhortation in general; or (4) the following warning about threats to their faith.\n\n
PHP 3:2	PHP 3:11	idm157939	 Paul warns the believers against being influenced by Jewish Christians who argued that circumcision is necessary for salvation. He then talks about his own conversion from Judaism to Christ.\n\n
PHP 3:2	PHP 3:2	idm157945	 **those dogs, . . . those mutilators:** Here Paul reverses the traditional Jewish practice of referring to Gentiles as *dogs* (cp. *Mark 7:27-28*). Paul’s strongest insults are directed against Jews who preached that Gentiles must be circumcised in order to be saved (cp. *2 Cor 11:13-15*; *Gal 1:6-9*; *5:1-6*, *12*).\n\n
PHP 3:3	PHP 3:3	idm157958	 Circumcision was understood as identifying the true people of God (see *Gen 17:10-14*), but those who put their trust in Christ are **the ones who are truly circumcised** in heart (see *Rom 2:28-29*; cp. *Jer 4:4*; *Eph 2:11*; *Col 2:11-13*).\n\n
PHP 3:4	PHP 3:4	idm157970	 **in my own effort** (literally *in the flesh*): Paul uses *flesh* here for self-reliance and human effort in contrast to reliance on Christ and empowerment by the Spirit.\n\n
PHP 3:5	PHP 3:6	idm157979	 If anyone could rely on Jewish credentials, Paul could: He practiced **the strictest obedience to the Jewish law** and was extremely **zealous** for the Jewish religion.\n\n
PHP 3:5	PHP 3:5	idm157987	 **circumcised when I was eight days old:** See *Gen 17:12*; *Lev 12:3*; *Luke 1:59*; *2:21*. • Paul was **a member of the Pharisees***,* the Jewish sect known for its strict observance of the law (see *Acts 23:6*; *26:5*).\n\n
PHP 3:6	PHP 3:6	idm158002	 **I harshly persecuted the church** (see *Acts 8:1-3*; *9:1-2*, *21*; *Gal 1:13*): His actions demonstrated his zeal for Judaism, to which the Good News of Jesus was seen as a threat. • Paul’s **righteousness***,* as judged by human standards, was another indication of his zeal for **the law** (see also *Gal 1:14*; for Paul’s later Christian view, cp. *Rom 3:23*; *7:14-25*).\n\n
PHP 3:7	PHP 3:8	idm158019	 As a Christian, Paul now regarded **these things** (*3:5-6*) as **worthless because of what Christ has done:** A believer’s relationship with God is defined by **knowing Christ** (cp. *3:10*; *John 17:3*) and nothing else. The only important thing is to **gain Christ***,* thus receiving the gift of eternal salvation (cp. *John 3:16*; *1 Jn 5:11-13*). By comparison, all other things are meaningless **garbage** (or *excrement*).\n\n
PHP 3:9	PHP 3:9	idm158037	 Paul here summarizes the contrast between his understanding of salvation and that of his opponents (*3:2*). • Believers **become one with** Christ by trusting him for salvation and sharing his life (cp. *John 15:1-5*). • We **become righteous***,* not by observing the law of Moses, but **through faith in Christ**. This is **God’s way of making us right with himself:** Salvation cannot be earned, but only received as a free gift (see *Rom 1:17*; *3:21-26*; *4:5-8*; *Gal 2:16*; *Eph 2:8-9*).\n\n
PHP 3:10	PHP 3:10	idm158055	 **to know Christ:** In knowing him, a person knows and is accepted by God (cp. *3:7-8*; *John 1:12-13*; *17:3*). • Believers **experience the mighty power that raised him from the dead***,* both now and in eternity (see *Rom 6:4-14*; *8:10-11*; *Col 3:1-4*). • **to suffer with him, sharing in his death:** Joined to Christ, a believer has the privilege of experiencing his life and death (see *Phil 1:29*; *2 Cor 4:10-12*; *Col 1:24*; *1 Pet 4:13-16*).\n\n
PHP 3:11	PHP 3:11	idm158075	 To **experience the resurrection from the dead** is to be saved from judgment and receive eternal life (see *Rev 20:4-6*). Paul was aware of God’s holiness and the severity of the final judgment (*Rev 20:11-15*); he knew he must persevere in his pursuit of Christ and salvation (cp. *Gal 5:5*).\n\n
PHP 3:12	PHP 4:1	idm158085	 Using himself as an example, Paul encourages the Philippians to pursue Christ and the hope of heaven with determination and strength.\n\n
PHP 3:13	PHP 3:14	idm158091	 **the race:** See *study note on 2:16*. • Paul was willing to give up everything else for the ultimate goal, **the heavenly prize** of eternal life.\n\n
PHP 3:15	PHP 3:15	idm158100	 Those who are **spiritually mature** (cp. *1 Cor 2:6*; *3:1*) will share Paul’s perspective that eternal things are most important in life (*Phil 3:12-14*; cp. *2 Cor 4:16-18*).\n\n
PHP 3:16	PHP 3:16	idm158111	 **hold on to the progress we have already made:** There must be no slipping or reversal; as believers, our conduct must be consistent with our spiritual understanding.\n\n
PHP 3:17	PHP 3:17	idm158118	 **pattern your lives after mine:** Paul’s serious pursuit of Christ and the life to which God had called him (*3:7-14*; *4:9*; *1 Cor 4:6*, *16-17*; *11:1*; *2 Thes 3:7-9*) contrasts markedly with that of the enemies of Christ who are described next (*Phil 3:18-19*).\n\n
PHP 3:18	PHP 3:18	idm158132	 The identity of the **enemies** is not known; they might have been (1) Jews or Jewish Christians proud of their circumcision (as in *3:2*), whose emphasis on observant Judaism contradicted **the cross of Christ**; (2) pseudo-believers living a worldly, immoral life (cp. *3:19*); or (3) professing believers who had rejected Paul’s cross-centered view of the Good News. Christ’s crucifixion as a criminal was scandalous and offensive to many (see *1 Cor 1:23*; cp. *Rom 9:33*; *1 Pet 2:8*).\n\n
PHP 3:19	PHP 3:19	idm158145	 **Their god is their appetite** may refer to their greed, their sensuality, or their self-interest (cp. *Rom 16:18*). • **they brag about shameful things:** This is best understood as a reference to immorality rather than to pride in being circumcised. • Eternal **destruction** is the ultimate judgment of God for those who reject Christ and live self-centered, sinful lives (see *2 Thes 1:8-9*; cp. *Phil 1:28*; *Matt 7:13*; *Rom 9:22*; *1 Cor 1:18*; *2 Thes 2:10*; *1 Tim 6:9*; *2 Pet 2:3*, *13*; *Jude 1:10*; *Rev 11:18*). • They are unable to see beyond **this life** (cp. *John 12:25*; *1 Jn 2:15-17*).\n\n
PHP 3:20	PHP 3:20	idm158169	 By contrast, believers who know their home is in **heaven** (see *Eph 2:19*) with **the Lord Jesus Christ** fill their minds with thoughts of heaven (see *Col 3:1-2*; cp. *1 Cor 15:19*; *1 Pet 2:11*) and Christ’s **return** (see *1 Cor 1:7*; *Titus 2:13*).\n\n
PHP 3:21	PHP 3:21	idm158184	 **change them into glorious bodies:** See *1 Cor 15:42-54*; cp. *Rom 8:23*. • **he will bring everything under his control:** See *1 Cor 15:24-27*.\n\n
PHP 4:1	PHP 4:1	idm158195	 **stay true to the Lord** (literally *stand in the Lord*): Cp. *1:27*. • Their continuing faithfulness to Christ was a deep source of **joy** to Paul and the **crown** for his hard work (see *1 Thes 2:19-20*).\n\n
PHP 4:2	PHP 4:9	idm158207	 Before closing, Paul addresses a small conflict in the church and writes a few words of encouragement.\n\n
PHP 4:2	PHP 4:2	idm158213	 **because you belong to the Lord, settle your disagreement:** The Lord’s people are to live together in harmony (see *2:2*; *1 Cor 1:10*; *Eph 4:1-3*, *31-32*; *Col 3:12-15*). The nature of the dispute between **Euodia and Syntyche** is unknown.\n\n
PHP 4:3	PHP 4:3	idm158226	 **my true partner** or *loyal Syzygus*: The Greek word suzuge is either a proper name or a description; this person is unknown. • Nothing more is known of **Clement**. • Those **whose names are written in the Book of Life** are true believers, destined to receive eternal life (see *Luke 10:20*; *Rev 3:5*; *13:8*; *17:8*; *20:12*, *15*; *21:27*; cp. *Exod 32:32*; *Ps 69:28*; *Dan 12:1*).\n\n
PHP 4:4	PHP 4:6	idm158247	 **rejoice! . . . pray . . . thank him:** Cp. *1 Thes 5:16-18*; both passages are addressed to persecuted churches; see also *Rom 12:12*.\n\n
PHP 4:4	PHP 4:4	idm158256	 In Paul’s letters, **joy** and rejoicing are a response to the Good News (see *Eph 5:19-20*). Joy is not dependent on circumstances; believers find joy **in the Lord** even in the midst of suffering. • **rejoice!** See *Phil 2:18*; *3:1*; *Rom 12:12*, *15*; *1 Thes 5:16*.\n\n
PHP 4:5	PHP 4:5	idm158271	 Believers are to be **considerate** in their responses to others, even in persecution. They can afford to leave justice in God’s hands because they know **the Lord is coming soon** (cp. *Jas 5:8-9*).\n\n
PHP 4:6	PHP 4:6	idm158280	 Believers need not **worry about anything** because the heavenly Father loves his children and cares about their needs, and he has invited his children to **pray about everything** (see *Matt 6:25-34*; *7:9-11*; *Rom 12:12*; *Eph 6:18*; *1 Thes 5:17*; *1 Pet 5:7*).\n\n
PHP 4:7	PHP 4:7	idm158294	 The life of trusting God (*4:6*) brings **God’s peace** (see also *Isa 26:3*; *John 14:27*; *Col 3:15*).\n\n
PHP 4:8	PHP 4:8	idm158305	 Paul urges the Philippians to focus on God’s good gifts so that, even during suffering and persecution, their lives will be exemplary and their minds and hearts will be filled with peace (*4:7*, *9*).\n\n
PHP 4:9	PHP 4:9	idm158313	 **all you learned and received from me:** Everything Paul had taught them by word or example about the kind of life God desires (see *3:17*; *1 Cor 4:6*, *16-17*; *2 Thes 3:7-9*).\n\n

PHP 4:11	PHP 4:12	idm158337	 As a slave of Christ, Paul has learned to **be content** with **every situation***,* whether he had **plenty or little**. His life was filled with the joy that comes from doing the will of God whatever the cost.\n\n
PHP 4:13	PHP 4:13	idm158347	 **through Christ:** With Christ’s help, Paul had the strength to **do everything**. In everything, especially while enduring suffering, Paul relied on the strength of Christ, who lived in him and worked through him (see *2 Cor 1:8-10*; *4:7-12*; *12:8-10*; *Gal 2:20*; *Col 1:27*).\n\n
PHP 4:14	PHP 4:14	idm158360	 The Philippians’ generosity and care were commendable, especially given Paul’s **present difficulty** in prison.\n\n
PHP 4:15	PHP 4:15	idm158367	 **the only ones who gave me financial help:** By contrast, Paul determined not to accept financial help from the Corinthians because it would have damaged the reputation of the Good News in their eyes (*1 Cor 9:11-18*; *2 Cor 11:7-12*). He did not face such a problem with the Philippians. • **when I first brought you the Good News:** See *Acts 16:11-40*.\n\n
PHP 4:16	PHP 4:16	idm158378	 After leaving Philippi (*4:15*) Paul had gone to **Thessalonica** (see *Acts 17:1-8*; cp. *1 Thes 2:1-14*).\n\n
PHP 4:17	PHP 4:17	idm158388	 **I don’t say this because I want a gift from you:** Paul preferred to support himself (see *Acts 18:3*; *1 Cor 4:12*; *9:3-18*; *2 Cor 11:7-11*; *12:14-15*). • The **reward** would be a blessing from God.\n\n
PHP 4:18	PHP 4:18	idm158401	 **Epaphroditus** (see also *2:25-30*) had carried **the gifts** from Philippi. • Their gifts were **a sweet-smelling sacrifice:** In the Old Testament, acceptable offerings were a pleasant fragrance to God (see *Lev 1:9*, *13*, *17*; *2:2*, *9*; *3:5*, *16*; cp. *Rom 12:1*; *Eph 5:2*).\n\n
PHP 4:20	PHP 4:20	idm158420	 Having reflected on God’s glorious blessings, Paul concludes appropriately with an expression of praise to God.\n\n
PHP 4:22	PHP 4:22	idm158426	 **Those in Caesar’s household** were believers employed in the service of the Roman government—perhaps those whom Paul had evangelized while in prison. They might have been **especially** close to Paul and concerned for him in prison (see *1:13*).\n\n
PHP 4:23	PHP 4:23	idm158435	 In closing his letters, Paul usually invokes **the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ** on those to whom he writes (see also *1:2*). Believers depend on Christ’s grace to save and sustain them. • The **spirit** is the part of the person that relates directly to God.\n\n
