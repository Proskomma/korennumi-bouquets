TIT 1:1	TIT 1:9	439	**Paul** greeted **Titus** as his *true son in the faith*. The hope and **faith** that they shared joined them together like family members. They believed that **Jesus** **Christ** is God’s Son and is the **Lord** of everything. As an **apostle**, Paul worked to teach people the truth about who Jesus is. Understanding this truth and believing it changes the way people live. Because of it they follow Jesus’ example for living. Paul called this **godly living**. It fills them with the hope of living for ever with Jesus. Titus worked together with Paul to help people believe in Jesus. To do this on **Crete**, he needed to appoint faithful leaders in the **churches**. Many things are required of people who serve as **church elders** or leaders. Paul listed ten things that they must do and five things that they mustn’t do. This is like the list Paul wrote about church leaders (1 Timothy 3:1-16). Above all, church leaders must be firmly committed to the truth about Jesus Christ.\n\n- **Paul:** Acts 8:1-8.\n\n- **Titus:** 2 Corinthians 7:2-16.\n\n- **Faith:** Matthew 4:1-11.\n\n- **Jesus:** Matthew 1:1-17.\n\n- **Christ:** Romans 5:12-21.\n\n- **Lord:** Matthew 3:1-12.\n\n- **Apostle:** Matthew 10:1-15.\n\n- **Godly living:** Matthew 6:1-15.\n\n- **Crete:** A large island near Greece in the Mediterranean Sea. Paul travelled to Crete during one of his journeys. He helped start several churches there, and Titus stayed to lead them. Some believers in Crete were Jews but most were Gentiles.\n\n- **Church:** Acts 9:1-19.\n\n- **Church elders:** Acts 1:12-26.
TIT 1:10	TIT 1:16	440	Some **Jewish Christian teachers** in Crete claimed to know God but didn’t obey him. They taught things that were against the truth about Jesus. They did this in order to take advantage of people and take their money. Paul called this group the *circumcision group*. They taught that Jesus didn’t save **Gentiles** unless they followed **Jewish laws**. The laws this group cared about most were the ones that separated Jews from Gentiles. They were about males being **circumcised** and about things that were considered **pure** or **clean**. Their understanding of what was right and wrong was based on human teachings. It wasn’t based on what Jesus taught. Their teachings caused problems for the community of believers and had to be stopped. Nothing they did to their bodies could make them clean or pure (Mark 7:1-23). Paul reminded Titus that Jesus’ followers are already pure and accepted by God.\n\n- **Jewish Christian teachers:** Galatians 1:1-10.\n\n- **Gentiles:** Matthew 15:21-28.\n\n- **Jewish laws:** Matthew 26:57-68.\n\n- **Circumcision:** Acts 15:1-35.\n\n- **Pure and impure:** 2 Corinthians 6:11 - 7:1.\n\n- **Clean and unclean:** Matthew 15:1-20.
TIT 2:1	TIT 2:15	441	Paul showed how each member in the **body of Christ** had important work to do. They were to treat one another in ways that taught unbelievers about God. These ways were very different from what was common in Crete. In Crete it was common to tell lies, be lazy and eat too much (Titus 1:12). The ways believers were to act were based on God’s **grace**. All family members should control themselves and treat one another with respect and love. They must be honest, kind and worthy of trust. God’s grace makes people able to say no to what is evil. Jesus set people free from the power of **sin**. Because of this, they can obey him and do what is just. They must obey **Christ** in their homes, in their work and in all their relationships. They can live **holy** lives now as they wait in hope for **Jesus to return**. Titus was to teach, correct and encourage the believers about all these things.\n\n- **Body of Christ:** Romans 12:1-21.\n\n- **Grace:** Matthew 20:1 16.\n\n- **Sin:** Matthew3:1-12.\n\n- **Christ:** Romans 5:12 21.\n\n- **Holy:** Matthew 6:1-15.\n\n- **Jesus’ return:** Romans 13:8-14.
TIT 3:1	TIT 3:15	442	Paul talked about being ready and committed to doing good (verses 1, 8 and 14). God doesn’t save people because they do **good works**. He saves them because he freely gives his kindness, love and **mercy**. When people receive God’s kindness, they change. They stop being full of hate and evil. They start being gentle and treating others with kindness and love like God does. This happens when God forgives their sins and the **Holy Spirit** gives them new life. Some believers in Crete didn’t want to do good to others. They preferred to fight and argue about things that didn’t matter. They wanted to divide the believers into groups instead of living together as a family. Paul warned Titus to stay away from people like that. One way Titus was to do good was to help believers who were travelling. Paul wanted Titus to make sure that they had what they needed for their trip. This would be an example to the churches in Crete. The believers were to provide for people when they had needs. That way they would be showing God’s kindness and love to everyone.\n\n- **Good works:** Matthew 21:18 27.\n\n- **Mercy:** 2 Corinthians 5:11 - 6:2.\n\n- **Holy Spirit:** Matthew 1:18-25.
