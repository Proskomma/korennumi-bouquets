PHP 1:1	PHP 1:11	401	**Paul** was the first person to tell people in **Philippi** about **Jesus** (Acts 16). After he left, *leaders and* **deacons** continued helping the **church**. Paul’s **prayers** for the Philippian **believers** were full of joy. He remained very close friends with them. They were partners with him in spreading the **good news** about Jesus. One way they did this was by sending Paul gifts of money. The money helped him continue his work as an **apostle**. God worked in the hearts of the believers. Because of this, God did good thing through them. Paul prayed for them to continue living the way Jesus had taught people to live. Then they would be ready for **Jesus’ return**.\n\n- **Paul:** Acts 8:1-8.\n\n- **Philippi:** Acts 16:11-24.\n\n- **Jesus:** Matthew 1:1-17.\n\n- **Deacon:** A follower of Jesus who serves in the church and helps other believers. Deacons work hard to help meet the needs of believers in the church. The work of the first deacons is described in Acts 6:1-7 and Acts 21:8.\n\n- **Church:** Acts 9:19.\n\n- **Prayer:** Matthew 6:1-15.\n\n- **Believers:** Acts :14-41.\n\n- **Good news:** Matthew 4:18-25.\n\n- **Apostle:** Matthew 10:1-15.\n\n- **Jesus’ return:** Romans 13:8-14.
PHP 1:12	PHP 1:30	402	Paul wrote this **letter** while he was in prison. This was a time of suffering and struggle for him. Yet he was full of joy because the truth about Jesus was being made known. Paul preached to everyone around him, even his guards. Other **believers** were encouraged by Paul’s example. While he was in prison, they spread the message about Jesus more boldly. Paul didn’t know what would happen to him in prison. If he were set free, he would keep working as an apostle. This would be helpful to the Philippians and also to others who hadn’t heard about Jesus yet. If he were punished and killed, he would be with Jesus. Paul longed to be with his **Lord**. Whether he lived or died what mattered to Paul was that **Christ** would receive **glory** through his life. Paul believed he would be set free. He talked about visiting the Philippians again. He encouraged the church to keep working together as one. They were being opposed in their city as they preached the good news about Jesus. Following Jesus as Lord led to suffering and struggle. Paul reminded them that the **Holy Spirit** gave them the strength they needed.\n\n- **Letter:** Romans 1:1-17.\n\n- **Believers:** Acts 2:42-47.\n\n- **Lord:** Matthew 3:1-12.\n\n- **Christ:** Romans 5:12-21.\n\n- **Glory:** Matthew 16:28 - 17:13.\n\n- **Holy Spirit:** Matthew 1:18-25.
PHP 2:1	PHP 2:2:18	403	Belonging to Jesus brought many blessings into the lives of the Philippian believers. Paul explained how believers should treat each other because of these blessings. Believers must treat others the way Jesus treated people. When he was on earth, Jesus thought and acted like a **servant**. He has always been Lord and God. But he made himself humble. He was willing to suffer and be put to death. He did all of this because he loved people and wanted to save them. One day all that God created will recognise that **Jesus Christ is Lord**. This is God’s *good purpose* for the **world**. God wants believers to be a part of fulfilling his purpose. They do this by following Jesus’ example. They mustn’t complain and argue. They are to serve one another and others who aren’t believers. This sets them apart like stars that shine brightly in the night sky. Paul was glad and joyful that this was happening among the Philippians.\n\n- **Servant of Jesus:** Romans 1:1-17.\n\n- **Lord Jesus Christ:** 1 Corinthians 1:1-17.\n\n- **World:** Matthew 4:1-11.
PHP 2:19	PHP 2:30	404	Paul wanted to visit the Philippian church again. But he didn’t know if he would be able to. Paul was humble when he made plans. He knew that what he hoped for would only happen *if the Lord allowed it.* He planned to send **Timothy** and **Epaphroditus** to encourage the Philippians. These men were examples of believers who thought and acted like Jesus. Timothy really cared about the Philippian believers. Epaphroditus was willing to give up his life to support Paul’s work as an apostle. Serving Jesus **faithfully** was what mattered most in both of their lives. Paul loved Timothy and Epaphroditus deeply. They were like a *son* and a *brother* to him.\n\n- **Timothy:** Acts 16:1-10.\n\n- **Epaphroditus:** A Greek believer from Philippi who worked with Paul. When Paul was in prison, Epaphroditus brought him gifts and money from the Philippian believers. He carried Paul’s letter to the Philippians when he returned to Philippi.\n\n- **Faithful:** Matthew 4:1-11.
PHP 3:1	PHP 3:21	405	The Philippian believers could be full of joy because they belonged to the Lord. Yet some **Jewish believers** taught that they had to be **circumcised** to belong to Jesus. Paul explained that people shouldn’t trust in circumcision or anything else that humans can do. Nothing they did could make them **right with God**. Paul had done many things that made him look like an important Jew. But those things didn’t save him. God saves people when they believe that Jesus is Lord and Christ. Paul had joy while he was alive because he knew Christ. He was already living as a **citizen of Jesus’ heavenly kingdom**. But his goal for the future was to be with Jesus for ever. Jesus will return to earth from **heaven**. He will bring everything on earth under his control. God will **raise Jesus’ followers from the dead**. They will have new bodies like Jesus had when he rose from the dead. Paul longed for this. He wanted the Philippians to follow his example and have that goal too.\n\n- **Jewish Christians:** Acts 10:34-48.\n\n- **Circumcision:** Acts 15:1-35.\n\n- **Right with God:** Romans 1:1-17.\n\n- **Citizens of heaven:** People are citizens of the nation where they live or where they were born. Believers are also citizens of heaven. Heaven is where God rules. This means they belong to God and are part of his kingdom. This is true even while they are alive on earth. God slowly spreads his heavenly kingdom on earth through believers. As citizens of heaven, they are messengers for God’s kingdom.\n\n- **Heaven:** Matthew 6:16-34.\n\n- **Resurrection:** Matthew 16:13-27.
PHP 4:1	PHP 4:9	406	In his **heart**, Paul was very close to the Philippians. Many of them had worked together with him to share the good news about Jesus. Two women were having a disagreement. Paul urged them to continue working together. What would make this possible was the truth that they all belonged to the Lord. All of them shared the hope of **eternal life** with Jesus. That is what Paul meant about the **book of life**. Earlier, Paul had told the Philippian believers to *think and act as Jesus did* (Philippians 2:5). Here he explained that this includes being full of joy and praying about everything. It also includes thinking about what is true, noble and lovely. Doing these things and thinking about these things leads to having God’s peace. This helps believers in every area of their lives.\n\n- **Heart:** Matthew 12:22-37.\n\n- **Eternal life:** Mark 10:17-31.\n\n- **Book of life:** A record of people who trust God. The Bible describes it as a list of names collected into a book. This was like the records of family lines that were important to Jews. It was also like the lists that governments made of everyone who lived in their country. It isn’t an actual book with names written in it. It’s a way of talking about who does and who doesn’t trust God to save them. The Old Testament mentions it as a book that God writes. It includes the names of people who are saved from evil and suffering. In the New Testament, this book belongs to the Lamb of God. It includes the names of those who follow Jesus faithfully.
PHP 4:10	PHP 4:23	407	Several times the Philippian believers shared what they had with Paul. The way they gave so freely was like a gift they gave to God. It was an offering that pleased God. It also made Paul happy. Paul went through many good times and also many difficult times. He learnt how to be content when he had everything he needed. He also learnt to be content when he didn’t have what he needed. Christ gave him the strength to be content no matter what was happening to him. Paul and the Philippians belonged to the same Lord. So Paul knew that God would make sure that the Philippians also had what they needed. God shares his *wonderful riches* with all who belong to Christ. Paul was talking about **spiritual blessings** (Ephesians 1:3). **God’s people** give him glory because of the wonderful gifts he shares with them.\n\n- **Spiritual blessings:** Ephesians 1:1-14.\n\n- **God’s people:** Matthew 1:18-25.
