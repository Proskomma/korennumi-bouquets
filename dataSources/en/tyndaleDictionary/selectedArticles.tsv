Bishop	BISHOP*\n\nOfficial in the church whose qualifications are listed in*1 Timothy 3:2-7*and*Titus 1:6-9*. The Greek word from which the English title “bishop” and the adjective “episcopal” are derived is often translated in modern versions as “elder,” “overseer,” “shepherd,” or “guardian,” corresponding closely to the current term “pastor.” Jesus is called “the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls” (*1 Pt 2:25*,kjv).\n\nIn the NT, “bishop,” and “elder” refer to the same office, as shown by the apostle Paul’s telling Titus to appoint “elders in every town” and then referring to those same individuals as “bishops” (*Ti 1:5, 7*). While at Miletus, Paul summoned the elders from the church at Ephesus and then addressed them as “overseers” or “guardians” (*Acts 20:17, 28*). In his letter to Philippi, Paul greeted the “bishops and deacons” (*Phil 1:1*). The fact that there were numerous bishops at Philippi, as well as in Ephesus, shows that the episcopal office had not yet developed into what it later became: a single bishop governing one or more churches.\n\nBishops obviously had positions of authority, but the duties of the office are not clearly defined in the NT. One task was to combat heresy (*Ti 1:9*) and to teach and expound the Scriptures (*1 Tm 3:2*). In addition, there is some evidence that a primary concern was with economic matters and the care of the poor, as well as with a general overseeing of the congregation. The lists of qualifications in Paul’s letters to Timothy and Titus indicate that a bishop was considered a leader in the congregation and a representative to the non-Christian world.*See**Elder*;*Pastor*;*Presbyter*.\n\n
Blasphemy	BLASPHEMY\n\nProfane or contemptuous speech or writing about (or action toward) God. In a general sense, “blasphemy” can refer to any slander, including any word or action that insults or devalues another being. In Greek literature the term was used for insulting or deriding living or dead persons, but it was extended to cover the gods as well, including both doubting the power of and mocking the nature of a god.\n\nIn the OT, “blasphemy” always means to insult God, either by attacking him directly or mocking him indirectly. Either way the glory and honor of God are lessened, so blasphemy is the opposite of praise. An Israelite might directly insult the “Name” by cursing God (*Lv 24:10-16*) or deliberately disobey God’s law (*Nm 15:30*). Either of those blasphemies was punishable by death, as was idolatry, the ultimate blasphemy (*Is 66:3*). It was thought that Gentiles, who had never experienced the power and majesty of the Lord, were the most likely blasphemers. Thus the king of Assyria blasphemed in equating the Lord with the gods of the nations he had already conquered (*2 Kgs 19:4-6, 22*). For his arrogance the king was doomed by the word of the prophet Isaiah. God was also mocked when Israel was exiled (*Is 52:5*), when Edom derided the desolate “mountains of Israel” (*Ez 35:12*,kjv), and when the enemy scoffed that God had not protected Jerusalem (*Ps 74:18*;*1 Macc 2:6*).\n\nIn the NT, blasphemy takes on the wider Greek meaning, for it includes slandering a human being (*Mt 15:19*; see also*Rom 3:8*;*1 Cor 10:30*;*Eph 4:31*;*Ti 3:2*), as well as God. It even includes mocking angelic or demonic powers, which is just as wrong as mocking any other being (*2 Pt 2:10-12*,*Jude 1:8-10*). In other words, slander, derision, and mocking of any kind are totally condemned in the NT.\n\nThe most common form of blasphemy in the NT is blasphemy against God. One might insult God directly (*Rv 13:6*;*16:9*), mock his word (*Ti 2:5*), or reject his revelation and its bearer (*Acts 6:11*). Jesus was accused of blasphemy when he claimed to have a prerogative belonging to God—the power to forgive sins (*Mk 2:7*).*John 10:33-36*reports an attempt to stone Jesus; his accusers said to him, “You, being a man, make yourself God” (v*33*). Jesus was condemned by the highest Jewish court, the Sanhedrin, on the charge of blasphemy, because he claimed to be the Son of Man (the Messiah) but in their view had given no evidence that he was such an exalted personage, thus appearing to mock the Messiah and, by extension, to mock God himself (*Mk 14:64*).\n\nNaturally the early Christians viewed Jesus’ trial from another perspective: the guards insulting Jesus (*Lk 22:64-65*) and the crowds and two dying robbers mocking him on the cross (*Mk 15:29-32*) were the real blasphemers. Observing how their Lord had been treated, the church was prepared to accept insult as their own lot, both personally (*1 Cor 4:13*;*1 Tm 1:13*;*Rv 2:9*) and as a response to their message (*Acts 13:45*;*18:6*). On the other hand, the church recognized that even Christians could blaspheme by giving way under persecution (*26:11*), by teaching false doctrine (*2 Pt 2:2*), or by behaving in an unbecoming fashion, which would bring others to think less of Christ (*Rom 2:24*;*Ti 2:5*).\n\nThe Bible makes clear that blasphemy is forgivable (*Mt 12:32*;*Mk 3:28-29*), but if a person will not repent, the only remedy is to turn him or her over to Satan to be taught the lesson (*1 Tm 1:20*).\n\n
Christ	CHRIST\n\nOfficial title given to Jesus in the NT. It signifies his office as anointed Savior and alludes to his spiritual qualifications for the task of saving his people. The word derives from GreekChristos*,*which translates Hebrew*Messiah*(*Jn 1:41*). Both terms come from verbs meaning “to anoint with sacred oil”; hence, as titles they mean “the Anointed One.” Applied to Jesus, they express the conviction that he had divine appointment for his office and function.\n\nIn the NT the title is used in combination with the given name, as “Jesus Christ” (*Mt 1:1*;*Mk 1:1*;*Rom 1:4*), “Christ Jesus” (niv*Rom 1:1*;*1 Cor 1:1*), with the article “the” (*Rom 7:4*), or with another title “Lord” (*Rom 16:18*). It is also used alone as the one favored substitute name or title for Jesus (*Jn 20:31*;*Rom 15:3*;*Heb 3:6*;*5:5*;*1 Pt 1:11, 19*).\n\nThe Gospels portray Jesus as modestly accepting the title and role of the Messiah. His baptism should be understood as his anointing to the threefold office of prophet, priest, and king. At his baptism by John (the new Elijah,*Mt 11:14*), Jesus received the outpouring of the Spirit and God’s mandate to begin his ministry (*Mt 3:16–4:17*). John himself denied being the anointed one but tacitly identified Jesus as the Christ (*Jn 1:20*;*Lk 3:14-17*). Jesus’ first disciples followed him because they knew he was the Messiah (*Jn 1:41*). The demons recognized him as “the Holy One [anointed] of God” (*Mk 1:24*; cf.*Mt 8:29*). The crowds followed him as the Prophet, the new Moses (*Jn 6:14, 32*), but deserted him when they understood that his kingdom was a spiritual, not a political realm (v*66*). The Twelve remained loyal, saying, “We believe . . . you are the Holy One of God” (*Jn 6:69*,niv). The confession of the disciples voiced by Peter and approved by Jesus as a divine revelation is “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God” (*Mt 16:16*,niv). At his trials the decisive factor in Jesus’ condemnation was his claim to be the Christ (*Mt 26:63-64, 68*;*27:11, 17, 22, 37*).\n\nAn important feature in the earliest Christian preaching was the proclamation that Jesus is the Christ (*Acts 2:36*;*3:18-20*;*9:22*;*28:23, 31*). This remains the earliest (*Mt 16:16*) and most basic article of Christian confession (*1 Cor 1:23*;*1 Jn 5:1*), affirming that Jesus perfectly fulfilled the role of anointed prophet, priest, and king as the servant of God for his people (*Lk 7:16*;*1 Cor 15:25*;*Heb 7:22-28*;*Rv 19:16*).\n\n*See also**Jesus Christ, Life and Teachings of*;*Messiah*.\n\n
Circumcision	CIRCUMCISION\n\nSurgical removal of the foreskin of the male reproductive organ. In Bible times circumcision was the seal of God’s covenant with Abraham (*Gn 17:1-14*). While circumcision originated as an ancient tribal or religious rite, since the early part of this century it has been practiced in Western nations for hygienic purposes. Many physicians believe that circumcision helps prevent genital cancers in both men and their wives, so that this minor operation is performed a few days after birth on nearly all newborn males in North America. Outside of Judaism the procedure no longer carries religious significance.\n\nPreview\n\n• *Circumcision in the Ancient World*\n\n• *Circumcision in the Old Testament*\n\n• *Circumcision in the New Testament*\n\nCircumcision in the Ancient World\n\nThe rite of circumcision is far older than the Hebrew people. Cave paintings give evidence that it was practiced in prehistoric times. Egyptian temple drawings show that the operation was common in 4000BCand probably earlier. Peoples practicing circumcision lived on almost every continent. The rite was observed among Central and South American Indians, Polynesians, the peoples of New Guinea, many Australian and African tribes, Egyptians, and pre-Islamic Arabs. The rite is not mentioned in the Koran, but because Muhammad was circumcised, tradition dictates that male Muslims follow the ancient custom. Arab ancestry is traced to Abraham through Ishmael (*Gn 17:20*), so a common age for Muslim circumcisions is 13, because Ishmael was circumcised at that age (v*25*).\n\nAmong the West Semitic people, the Ammonites, Edomites, Midianites, Moabites, and Phoenicians all practiced circumcision (*Jer 9:25-26*). The Philistines, however, did not (*Jgs 14:3*;*15:18*;*1 Sm 14:6*;*17:26, 36*;*18:25, 27*;*31:4*;*2 Sm 1:20*;*3:14*;*1 Chr 10:4*).\n\nYoung men were usually circumcised at puberty, evidently in preparation for marriage and entrance into full tribal responsibilities. The Hebrews were the only ancient practitioners of circumcision to observe the rite in infancy, thus freeing it from association with fertility rituals.\n\nCircumcision in the Old Testament\n\nIn the Bible the practice of circumcision began in*Genesis 17*as a sign of the covenant between God and Abraham. God promised Abraham a land and, through a son yet to be conceived, numerous descendants, from whom kings would come. Blessings would come upon Abraham and through him to all nations (*Gn 12:1-3*). After the covenant was formally inaugurated (ch*15*), God sealed it, ordering Abraham to be circumcised along with all the males in his household (*17:9-13*).\n\nCircumcision was to be an expression of faith that God’s promises would be realized. Because Abraham’s faith had lapsed (*Gn 16*) even after he had seen the awesome display of God’s majesty (*15:9-17*), a permanent reminder of God’s covenant promises was placed on his body and the bodies of his male descendants (*17:11*). This sign was so closely related to God’s covenant promise that the rite itself could be termed the “covenant” (*Gn 17:10*;*Acts 7:8*).\n\nCircumcision was to be performed on the eighth day after birth (*Gn 17:12*;*Lv 12:1-3*; see*Gn 21:4*;*Lk 1:59*;*2:21*;*Acts 7:8*;*Phil 3:5*), customarily by the boy’s father (*Gn 17:23*;*21:4*;*Acts 7:8*), at which time a name would be given (*Lk 1:59*;*2:21*). Flint knives were used in the early days (*Ex 4:25*;*Jos 5:2-3*). Later, the rite was carried out by a trained practitioner called a*mohel**.*Medical research has determined that prothrombin, a substance in the blood that aids in clotting, is present in greater quantity on the eighth day than at any other time in life.\n\nTheological Meaning\n\nCircumcision had to do with the fulfillment of God’s promise concerning Abraham’s descendants (*Gn 17:9-12*). Because it was applied to the reproductive organ, the sign involved the propagation of the race. Its application to the eight-day-old infant demonstrates the gracious character of God’s promise to Abraham’s descendants and indicates that God’s people are in need of cleansing grace from birth (*Lv 12:1-3*). The promises of the covenant were reaffirmed to each generation before the recipients were able to respond in either faith or unbelief; nothing in the hearts of the chosen people could either bring about or thwart the ultimate fulfillment of the promises given to Abraham and his posterity.\n\nCircumcision also had to do with the fulfillment of God’s promise concerning the land (*Gn 17:8*). The land was God’s holy possession, and the Israelites had to be holy to possess it. When Joseph and his descendants were in Egypt, they continued to circumcise their sons. But following the great sin at Mt Sinai after the exodus, the unbelieving Israelites failed to place the covenant sign upon their children as they wandered in the wilderness. Because the new generation had not been circumcised, the people were unprepared to enter the Promised Land. Therefore, God ordered Joshua to circumcise the men of Israel. The people’s obedient response was an act of faith, since the armies of the enemy were camped nearby as the Israelite warriors lay incapacitated by the surgery (*Jos 5:2-9*).\n\nFrom the beginning, participation in the covenant promises was open to persons outside Abraham’s household (*Gn 17:12-13*).*Exodus 12:43-49*gives non-Israelites the opportunity to participate in the Passover if they are willing to fulfill the same stipulation placed upon the Jews—that of circumcision.\n\nThe provision for admission to God’s people by reception of the covenant sign was abused by Jacob’s sons when circumcision was made a precondition for intermarriage with the Shechemites. While the Shechemites were disabled by their wounds, Simeon and Levi killed them, plundering the city to exact retribution for the rape of their sister Dinah (*Gn 34*).\n\nThe sign of the covenant was not to be treated lightly. The penalty of excommunication rested upon the uncircumcised (*Gn 17:14*). The strange incident recorded in*Exodus 4:24-26*seems to have been God’s reminder to Moses of the stipulations of the covenant made with Abraham. Moses had proved an unfaithful servant of the Lord by neglecting to circumcise his son but was rescued from judgment when his wife Zipporah took a flint rock and circumcised the boy, throwing the bloody foreskin at her husband’s feet.\n\nCircumcision in the New Testament\n\nJohn the Baptist was circumcised, as were Jesus and Paul (*Lk 1:59*;*2:21*;*Phil 3:5*). Jesus recognized the cleansing significance of circumcision (*Jn 7:22-23*), contrasting the rite with his healing ministry that made a man completely well and therefore ceremonially “clean.” Just before he was stoned, Stephen referred to the covenant of circumcision, charging that his Jewish accusers, like their ancestors, were stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, always resisting the Holy Spirit (*Acts 7:8, 51*).\n\nFor a time the first Christians continued to participate in the Jewish rites and customs, even attending the services of the temple (*Acts 3:1*;*5:21, 42*). As Gentiles came to Christ, controversy arose between those who said that participation in the covenant community required circumcision and those who believed the rite was unnecessary. It was argued that since the covenant promise of the Messiah was given to the Jews, Gentiles must first be circumcised and become Jews before they could receive salvation in Christ.\n\nIn the time of Christ, many Jews misunderstood the significance of circumcision, believing that the physical act was necessary for and a guarantee of salvation. Thus for Jews the observance became not only a symbol of religious privilege but also a source of racial pride (*Phil 3:4-6*). These Jews associated the ceremony with the Mosaic law rather than the promise to Abraham (*Jn 7:22*;*Acts 15:1*). Because Greeks and Romans did not practice circumcision, Jews had come to be called “the circumcision” (kjv*Acts 10:45*;*11:2*;*Rom 15:8*;*Gal 2:7-9*;*Eph 2:11*;*Ti 1:10*), and following OT practice (*Ez 28:10*;*31:18*;*32:19-32*), Gentiles were termed “the uncircumcision” (kjv*Gal 2:7*;*Eph 2:11*).\n\nWhile visiting Caesarea, Jewish believers were amazed to realize that uncircumcised Gentiles received the purifying gift of the Holy Spirit (*Acts 10:44-48*). Moses had promised that God would circumcise the hearts of his people to love the Lord with heart and soul (*Dt 30:6*), and Ezekiel had prophesied that the Lord would sprinkle clean water on his people, giving them a new heart and putting his Spirit within them (*Ez 36:25-27*). As these Jewish believers saw the prophecy that God would pour out his Spirit upon all flesh (*Jl 2:28*;*Acts 2:17*) being fulfilled, they realized that the inward reality symbolized by circumcision could be accomplished without the physical sign. Thus, the gentile believers were immediately baptized.\n\nNot all the Jewish believers were immediately willing to accept Gentiles into the church. When Peter returned to Jerusalem after his visit to Caesarea, “the circumcision party” criticized him. But after telling how the Spirit had fallen upon the Gentiles, Peter declared that he could not stand against God. At this the Jewish believers were silenced and glorified God that repentance unto life had been granted to Gentiles (*Acts 11:1-3, 15:8*).\n\nCertain “Judaizers” of the Pharisaic party taught the Christians in Antioch that circumcision was necessary for salvation (*Acts 15:1, 5*). After debating these persons, Paul and Barnabas went to Jerusalem to consult with the other apostles and elders (v*2*). Peter argued that God had given the Spirit to Gentiles and “cleansed their hearts by faith,” affirming that “we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they will” (vv*8-9*,*11*,rsv). Therefore, James and the other Jerusalem leaders agreed that circumcision should not be imposed on the Gentiles (vv*13-21*).\n\nIt was decided that Peter, James, and John would be entrusted with the gospel to “the circumcised,” while Paul and Barnabas would preach to “the uncircumcised” (*Gal 2:7-9*). Because of his evangelistic policy to be “all things to all people” with respect to spiritually indifferent matters of custom (*1 Cor 9:19-23*), Paul had Timothy circumcised. Timothy was reckoned by Jews as one of their race because his mother was Jewish (*Acts 16:1-2*). But Paul resisted attempts to have Titus circumcised, since he was a Gentile (*Gal 2:3*). Paul apparently allowed Jewish believers to circumcise their sons (*Acts 21:21*).\n\nYet Paul charged that those who argued that the Galatian Christians must be circumcised and keep the law did not keep it themselves but wanted to boast in the Galatians’ flesh and avoid persecution for the cross of Christ (*Gal 6:12-13*)—persecution Paul was willing to bear (*5:11*). Granting for the sake of argument the Pharisaic assumption that salvation could be merited by keeping the law, Paul declared that those who received circumcision must obey every other Jewish law (vv*2-3*). Christ would be “of no advantage” to those who “would be justified by the law”; this attempt at works righteousness would evidence that the Galatians were “severed from Christ,” having “fallen from grace” (vv*2-4*). These Christians were being tempted to turn to “a different gospel” (*1:6-7*).\n\nBecause of the serious threat the Judaizers posed to the gospel of free grace, Paul wished that those who unsettled the Galatians would “mutilate themselves” (*Gal 5:12*). He termed the Judaizers “dogs” and “evil workers” (kjv“concision”), asserting that Christians are “the true circumcision,” because they worship God in spirit and glory in Christ Jesus, putting no confidence in human works to merit salvation (*Phil 3:2-3*).\n\nPaul taught that circumcision was indeed of value to Jews, for it was the sign that to them had been committed the “oracles of God,” that is, God’s word concerning the promise of salvation (*Rom 3:1-3*). He reminded the prideful Ephesians that as Gentiles they had once been “strangers to the covenants of promise,” not bearing the covenant sign in their flesh (*Eph 2:11-12*; see*Col 2:13*). Likewise, Jews had no cause for pride, for disobedience could cause outward circumcision to be counted as uncircumcision (*Rom 2:25*).\n\nPaul and the other apostles followed Moses and the OT prophets in teaching that true circumcision was a matter of the heart. The teaching of the NT goes further to affirm that a faithful believer, though physically uncircumcised, is regarded by God as circumcised, “for he is not a real Jew who is one outwardly, nor is true circumcision something external and physical” (*Rom 2:28*,rsv). Both Jews and Gentiles are saved by grace (*Acts 15:11*), and circumcised and uncircumcised alike are justified on the ground of their faith, apart from works of the law (*Rom 3:28-30*).\n\nAbraham served as an example of a person whose faith was reckoned to him as righteousness (*Rom 4:3*; see*Gn 15:6*). Paul argued that both Gentiles and Jews are justified by faith, because Abraham was accounted righteous before he was circumcised. Abraham did not receive circumcision to obtain righteousness, but as a sign or seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. Thus, Abraham is the father of all who believe without being circumcised, as well as those who are circumcised but also follow the example of Abraham’s faith (*Rom 4:9-12*; see*Gal 3:6-9*).\n\n*See also**Baptism*;*Cleanness and Uncleanness, Regulations Concerning*;*Uncircumcision*.\n\n
Crete	CRETE\n\nFourth largest island in the Mediterranean, lying approximately 60 miles (97 kilometers) southeast of Greece and 110 miles (177 kilometers) southwest of Turkey. It is 160 miles (257.4 kilometers) long from east to west, with a width of approximately 36 miles (58 kilometers), an area of 3,200 square miles (5,149 square kilometers). Through the island stretches a mountain range dominated in the center by the sacred Mt Ida (altitude 9,000 feet or 2,742 meters). These mountains slope down sharply to the southern coast, with the result that most of the inhabitants live on the more gradual northern slopes.\n\nCivilization in ancient Crete reached its climax with the Minoan era (3000–1100BC). The spectacular remnants of this high civilization may be seen best at Knossos, thanks to the labors of British archaeologist Arthur Evans. About 1950–1900BC, beautiful pottery was produced and exported. Metallurgy was highly developed, and hieroglyphic writing was introduced. This civilization was suddenly and dramatically destroyed in a mysterious manner about 1700BC, perhaps by volcanic eruption or earthquake. Following this, the towns and palaces were rebuilt, and the island enjoyed its greatest prosperity. The partially restored palace of Knossos amazes today’s visitor with superb frescoes, stairways, and pillars. All this ended in destruction about 1450BC. Some think it was caused by the volcanic explosion at the nearby island of Santorini.\n\nCrete is important in the history of the Christian church. When Paul went to Rome as a prisoner, the ship sought refuge from a storm at Fair Havens (*Acts 27:8*). The ship tried in vain to reach the more commodious harbor at Phoenix (v*12*) but was blown off course and sought refuge at an island off the southwest coast of Crete, called Cauda (v*16*). Paul may have visited Crete after imprisonment in Rome, for in his Letter to Titus, he said, “I left you on the island of Crete” (*Ti 1:5*,nlt). On the basis of this and other evidence, many scholars conclude that Paul was released and had an extended ministry before his second imprisonment and execution (*2 Tm 4:6*). Paul had little good to say about the people of Crete, quoting one of their own poets as saying they were “liars, cruel animals, and lazy gluttons” (*Ti 1:12*). But the gospel must have made quite a difference there, for today the name of Titus is honored in many villages, churches, and monasteries.\n\nBecause of its location and its relative fertility, Crete has been a prize of war and of commerce. The island was conquered by Rome in 67BCand became a separate province. The inhabitants prospered under the Romans and later under the Greek Christians (Byzantines). The Saracens (Muslims) occupied the island for over a century (AD823–960). After centuries of Christian leadership, it was conquered by the Turkish sultan, and civilization languished (1669–1898). In the 20th century Crete has been a part of Greece, except for a period of German occupancy during World War II.\n\n
DeaconDeaconess	DEACON, DEACONESS*\n\nTerms designating an officer in a local church, derived from a Greek word meaning “servant” or “minister.” The term “diaconate” is used for the office itself or for the collective body of deacons and deaconesses. As with many other biblical words used today in a technical sense, the words “deacon” and “deaconess” began as popular, nontechnical terms. Both in secular first-centuryADGreek culture and in the NT, they described a variety of services.\n\nOrigins of the Concept\n\nGreek Usage\n\nReferences have been found in extrabiblical writings where the Greek word “deacon” meant “waiter,” “servant,” “steward,” or “messenger.” In at least two instances it indicated a baker and a cook. In religious usage the word described various attendants in pagan temples. Ancient documents show “deacons” presiding at the dedication of a statue to the Greek god Hermes. Serapis and Isis, Egyptian deities, were served by a college of “deacons” presided over by a priest.\n\nGeneral New Testament Usage\n\nThe same word was used by biblical writers in a general sense to describe various ministries or services. Not until later in the development of the apostolic church was the term applied to a distinct body of church officers. Among its general usages, “deacon” refers to a waiter at meals (*Jn 2:5, 9*), a king’s attendant (*Mt 22:13*), a servant of Satan (*2 Cor 11:15*), a servant of God (*6:4*), a servant of Christ (*11:23*), a servant of the church (*Col 1:24-25*), and a political ruler (*Rom 13:4*).\n\nThe NT presents servanthood in the sense of ministry or service as a mark of the whole church—that is, as normative for all disciples (*Mt 20:26-28*;*Lk 22:26-27*). Jesus’ teaching on the final judgment equates ministry with feeding the hungry, welcoming strangers, clothing the naked, and visiting the sick and imprisoned (*Mt 25:31-46*). The entire NT emphasizes compassionate care for individuals’ physical and spiritual needs as well as the giving of oneself to meeting those needs. Such service is ultimately a ministry to Christ himself (v*45*).\n\nOrigin of the Office\n\nThere is little question that before the end of the first century the general term for service or ministry became a kind of title for a position or office in the church. That development evidently went through several stages.\n\nSome biblical scholars emphasize a relationship between the*hazzan*of the Jewish synagogue and the Christian office of deacon. The*hazzan*opened and closed the synagogue doors, kept it clean, and handed out the books for reading. It was probably to such a person that Jesus handed the scroll of Isaiah after finishing his reading (*Lk 4:20*).\n\nOther NT scholars give considerable attention to the choosing of the seven (*Acts 6:1-6*); they see that action as a historical forerunner of a more developed structure (*Phil 1:1*;*1 Tm 3:8-13*—the two specific references to an “office” of deacon). Luke devoted considerable attention in Acts to the selection of a new set of church leaders. Overworked with a variety of responsibilities, the 12 apostles proposed a division of labor to ensure care for the Hellenist (Greek-speaking) widows in the church’s daily distribution of food and alms. Seven men of good repute, full of the Spirit and of wisdom (*Acts 6:3*), subsequently became prominent in the Jerusalem congregation, doing works of charity and caring for physical needs.\n\nSome scholars caution that the diaconate should not be exclusively linked with charitable works, since the Greek word used in*Acts 6:2*is related to the word translated “ministry of the word” in verse*4*. Those chosen to oversee the care for physical needs were people of spiritual stature. Stephen, for instance, “full of grace and power, did great wonders and signs” (*6:8*,rsv). Philip, appointed as one of the seven in*Acts 6*, “preached good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ” (*8:12*). Philip also baptized (v*38*) and is referred to as an evangelist (*21:8*).\n\nDeacons in the Early Church\n\nThose who cite*Acts 6*as a preliminary stage of the office of deacon refer to the spread of the practice from the church in Jerusalem to the gentile congregations sprouting elsewhere. Many churches probably took the appointing of “the Jerusalem seven” as a pattern to follow, some even adopting the number seven. In a letter of the third-century pope Cornelius, for example, the church of Rome was said to have maintained seven for the number of deacons.\n\nBy the time the church of Philippi received its instructions from the apostle Paul (c.AD62) and Timothy had Paul’s first letter in hand, “deacon” had become a technical term referring to a specific office in the churches. In*Philippians 1:1* Paul addressed the church in general and then added “with bishops and deacons.” Some interpreters consider that to be a clear establishment of two distinct groups within the larger church body, though no further description is given. Possibly the deacons of that congregation were responsible for collecting and then dispatching the offerings referred to (*Phil 4:14-18*).\n\nIn*1 Timothy 3:8-13*instructions are given about qualifications for the office of deacon. Although that is the most detailed treatment of the subject in the NT, it is actually quite sketchy. Most of the qualifications, dealing with personal character and behavior, are similar to those for a bishop. For instance, a deacon is to be truthful, monogamous, “not addicted to much wine,” and a responsible parent. Verse*11*, requiring that “the women likewise must be serious, not slanderers, but temperate, faithful in all things” (rsv), may refer not to deacons’ wives but to deaconesses, as several translations note (niv,neb). In any event, it is clear that women participated in the work of the diaconate.\n\nIn contrast to the office of bishop (*1 Tm 3:2*), deacons are not described as providing teaching or hospitality. In fact, no mention is made of any functional qualifications to clarify deacons’ or deaconesses’ roles in the early church. The character qualifications listed are appropriate for those with monetary and administrative responsibilities (as*Acts 6:1-6*suggests). Timothy is told that good deacons will not go unrewarded; not only will their faith increase, but also their good standing among those whom they serve (*1 Tm 3:13*).\n\nThe NT writings indicate that to be chosen as a deacon or deaconess is a high compliment and affirmation. Named as “deacons” were Timothy (*1 Thes 3:2*;*1 Tm 4:6*), Tychicus (*Col 4:7*), Epaphras (*1:7*), Paul (*1 Cor 3:5*)—and even Christ (*Rom 15:8*, “servant”). Biblical “deaconing” is not characterized by power and prominence but by service to others. In imitation of Jesus’ life, the deacon or deaconess followed the servant pattern. The Christian diaconate thus contrasted sharply with the prevailing Greek thought of service, which was considered unworthy of the dignity of free men. (The Greek philosopher Plato wrote, “How can man be happy when he has to serve someone?”)\n\nThe office of deacon differed from the office of elder, which was adapted from a definite Jewish pattern in the OT (see*Nm 11:16-17*;*Dt 29:10*). The diaconate, on the other hand, developed from the strong, personal, historical example of Jesus, the servant who compassionately met concrete human needs.\n\nAs the office of deacon became more firmly established, its duties could be defined as those of pastoral care. The poor and the sick received their service not only physically but also with instruction and consolation. The homes of church members became familiar territory to a deacon or deaconess. A pattern of visitation was established to discover and then meet the needs of the church body at large. Although that included the administration of funds, it went far beyond it. Those who served as deacons and deaconesses undoubtedly became symbols of loving care for the church in general.\n\nWhere the office of deacon fits into the larger pattern of church order within the NT is difficult to determine because of the obvious variety present during the formative years. Some church historians conclude that as ecclesiastical structure developed, elders provided congregational leadership. Deacons assisted them, especially in social services and pastoral care. The late first and early second centuries witnessed a distinctive threefold ministry of deacons, elders (presbyters), and bishops. Bishops or “overseers” began to exercise authority over areas or groups of churches.\n\nDeaconess\n\nWhere did women fit into the ministry of the early church? Paul’s inclusion of references to women in ministry is striking when compared with the role of women in general in the first century. He commended Phoebe for her service in the church at Cenchrea, using the word “deacon” to describe her (*Rom 16:1*). He praised her as a “helper” (v*2*), a word that denotes leadership qualities (cf.*Rom 12:8*;*1 Tm 3:4-5*). Some scholars have used that reference as an example of early development of the office of deaconess. Others have interpreted it in a nontechnical sense, meaning that Phoebe functioned in a generally serving role and thus was worthy of recognition at Rome. Whether “deacon” was used technically or descriptively, ministry for both women and men in the NT was patterned after the example of Jesus, who “came not to be served but to serve” (*Mk 10:45*). Because of the large number of female converts (*Acts 5:14*;*17:4*), women functioned in such areas of ministry as visitation, instruction in discipleship, and assistance in baptism. Deaconesses are mentioned in third-century documents as administering baptism to female converts.\n\nConsidering the rigid separation of the sexes in the Near East at that time, female participation in church ministry stands out in bold relief. A governor of Bithynia, Pliny the Younger (early second century), in his*Correspondence with Trajan*verified women officeholders in the church. Pliny also mentioned two deaconesses who were martyred for the cause of Christ.\n\n*See also**Bishop*;*Elder*;*Pastor*;*Presbyter*.\n\n
Elder	ELDER\n\nPerson who, by virtue of position in the family, clan, or tribe; or by reason of personality, prowess, stature, or influence; or through a process of appointment and ordination, exercised leadership and judicial functions in both religious and secular spheres in the ancient world, both among biblical and nonbiblical peoples. The roots of the development of the presbytery (group of elders) in the NT and postapostolic church originate in Judaism and the OT, though the figure of the elder or groups of elders can also be found in the world surrounding ancient Israel and in the Greco-Roman world of the NT period.\n\nIn the Old Testament\n\nThe elder, or the institution of elders, is closely linked with the tribal system. Tribes were composed of clans, and clans of large, extended family units. By virtue of age and function in a patriarchal society, the father of a family ruled. This fact of age, as well as the wisdom and maturity invested in older persons, is undoubtedly the origin of the authority that these elders exercised. A clan was ruled by the heads of the families constituting it, forming a council of elders. In time of war, each clan furnished a contingent; these were led by a chief, probably chosen from the ranks of the elders.\n\nIn Israel’s premonarchy period, local administration and judicial action was largely in the hands of those elders. In the exodus narrative, it was the elders of Israel (heads of families) who were instructed by Moses concerning the first Passover meal (*Ex 12:21-22*). It was these elders who, in*Exodus 18:12*, met with Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, and from whose ranks were chosen worthy representatives to assist Moses in the interpretation of the law of God and the administration of justice (*18:13-23*). Similarly, according to*Numbers 11:16-17*, Moses was instructed by God to select 70 men from among the elders of Israel to assist him in leadership of the people. In this latter account, the elders were marked by a special endowment of God’s Spirit. In the former the elders—chosen as coadministrators with Moses—were those known to be trustworthy.\n\nA central function of elders was the administration of justice. They were the “judges,” who sat “in the gate,” the traditional courtroom of ancient villages and towns. Here disputes and trials were settled by the elders, and community affairs were discussed and decisions made (*Gn 23:10, 18*;*Jb 29:7*;*Prv 24:7*;*31:23*). The preservation and application of the law was clearly in the hands of elders who sat at the gate of the town (*Dt 19:12*;*21:19*;*22:15*;*25:7-10*).*Ruth 4:1-12*provides an excellent description of such a process.\n\nDuring the period of the monarchy, local administration and judicial authority continued to be invested in councils of elders. At the end of Saul’s reign, David sent messages and gifts to the elders of the towns of Judah (*1 Sm 30:26*), obviously recognizing that his efficient rule would depend on their goodwill and allegiance. In the time of Jehu (*2 Kgs 10:5*), we hear of elders in Samaria, side by side with a governor and master of the palace. To facilitate her plot against Naboth, Jezebel wrote instructions to the elders and nobles of Jezreel (*1 Kgs 21:8-11*). Again, Josiah convened the elders of Judah and Jerusalem to hear the reading of the law and to enter with him into a new covenant of obedience (*2 Kgs 23:1*). It is clear that the elders of Israel were now responsible for the application of the law within their jurisdictions. Besides administrative and judicial functions, elders also assumed cultic roles (*Ex 24:1, 9*;*Lv 4:14-15*).\n\nThe institution of the elders survived the collapse of the royal institutions. Elders were present during the exile (*Ez 8:1*;*14:1*;*20:1-3*) as well as after the return (e.g.,*Ezr 10:16*).\n\nIn Judaism of the New Testament Period\n\nWhile use of the title “elder” to designate officers of various Greek cult associations and village magistrates may have influenced the development of community structure in the gentile churches, the Christian office (or function) of elder stems from a very similar institution within Judaism. In the first three Gospels and in Acts there are numerous references to elders as functionaries within the communal and religious life of Judaism. Generally they are mentioned together with one or more other groups of functionaries (quoting thersv): “elders and chief priests and scribes” (*Mt 16:21*); “chief priests and elders of the people” (*21:23*;*26:3, 47*); “scribes and elders” (*26:57*;*27:41*); “chief priests and elders” (*27:1, 3, 12, 20*); “rulers and elders and scribes” (*Acts 4:5*); “rulers of the people and elders” (v*8*). From these NT passages we cannot determine what exactly their functions were, or how they differed from rulers or scribes. However, the duties of Jewish elders are clearly described in the tractate*Sanhedrin*in the Mishnah, as well as in the community rule books of the Qumran ascetics, discovered among the Dead Sea Scrolls.\n\nEach Jewish community had its council of elders, who had general administrative oversight and represented the community in relations with Roman authorities. Their primary duty was judicial. They were custodians of the law and its traditional interpretations (see*Mt 15:2*), and they were charged with both its enforcement and the punishment of offenders. The most important of these councils of elders was the Sanhedrin in Jerusalem, a group of 71 men who acted as the final court for the entire nation.\n\nIn the Christian Community\n\nSince the primitive church eventually regarded itself as the new Israel (*Mt 21:43*;*Gal 6:16*), it is easy to see why it should gradually adopt the institution of elders. Though it is difficult to make out the order that prevailed in the first Christian communities, because it apparently varied according to place and time in both form and extent, the presence and functioning of elders was part of the reality of early church life.\n\nIn Luke’s account of the origin and spread of Christianity, the elders are already present in the church at Jerusalem. In Acts we see Christians at Antioch sending famine relief “to the elders [of the Judean churches] by Barnabas and Saul” (*Acts 11:30*). On their first missionary journey, Paul and Barnabas “appointed elders in every church” (*14:23*). Later, Paul and Barnabas were sent from Antioch to Jerusalem “to the apostles and elders” about the question of circumcision of gentile Christians (*15:2*), and were “welcomed by the church, and the apostles, and the elders” (v*4*), who gathered to hear the case and resolve the issue (vv*6-23*).\n\nWho these elders were, and how they were chosen, we are not told. It seems possible to argue, on the basis of Jewish precedent, that age and prominence gave them the privilege of rendering special service within the community. Veneration for age was a deeply rooted sentiment among Jews, and the name “presbyter” (elder) was derived from Jewish usage. It is also possible that, like the appointment of “the seven” for special service by the laying on of hands (*6:1-6*), the first elders in the Jerusalem church were appointed by the apostles. Apparently they functioned in the Christian community in ways comparable to the elders in the Jewish communities and the Sanhedrin (*11:30*;*15:2-6, 22-23*;*16:4*;*21:18*).\n\nPaul apparently continued the practice among the gentile churches, though elders are not mentioned in the earliest Pauline writings. They are mentioned only in the Pastoral Epistles (*1 Tm 5:17, 19*;*Ti 1:5*). On his last journey to Jerusalem, Paul summoned the elders of the church at Ephesus to Miletus (*Acts 20:17*) to bid them farewell, and to instruct them to be faithful in their task of overseeing and caring for the Christian flock, the church of God (*20:28*).\n\nAlthough elders are not explicitly mentioned in Paul’s early letters, they may have been among the leaders who presided over the congregations (*Rom 12:8*;*1 Thes 5:12-13*).*Philippians 1:1* certainly reveals a definite stratification of leadership (“overseers and deacons”) within a young Pauline congregation. And*1 Timothy 5:17*, reflecting what is often considered a later phase in the development of church government, attributes the functions of preaching and teaching to the ruling elders. Further, that Christian elders exercised pastoral functions may be inferred from*1 Peter 5:1-5*and*James 5:14*.\n\nThere is one passage where we find a possible identification of an apostle (Peter) as also being an elder: “I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ” (*1 Pt 5:1a*,rsv). This text may indicate that elders were appointed and functioned as extensions of apostolic servanthood. Paul’s practice of appointing elders in the churches before his departure may support such a suggestion. The fact that in the tradition of the later church the “elder” of 2 and 3 John was identified as the apostle John points in a similar direction. Though such an identification is implicit, the apostles could function as elders but not the other way around.\n\nThe elders had several functions. For example,*1 Timothy 5:17*speaks of elders as involved in preaching and teaching;*James 5:14*sees them involved in a healing ministry;*1 Peter 5:2*exhorts them to tend the flock. Thus, the prophets and teachers who led the church at Antioch (according to*Acts 13:1-3*) may well have been the elders of this community.\n\nThe diaconate, too, whose roots are to be seen in the selection of “the seven” for service to those in need (*Acts 6:1-3*), was not restricted to purely external service. Two of these men, whom Luke introduces to us as deacons, appear at the same time as evangelists who were particularly effective as preachers of the Word, performers of miracles, expounders of the Scriptures (Stephen,*Acts 6:8-10*; Philip,*Acts 8:4-13, 26-40*).\n\nWhereas in the later church bishops and elders were clearly distinguished, the NT reflects an early period when these offices were virtually synonymous. In Paul’s farewell speech at Miletus (*Acts 20*), addressed specifically to the Ephesian church elders (v*17*), he tells them that the Holy Spirit has made them “overseers, to care for the church of God” (v*28*). Whether “overseer” is used here in the later technical sense of bishop or the more general sense of guardian is not clear. However, in*Titus 1:5-7*, the elders of verse*5*are clearly the same persons as the bishops of verse*7*. Again, the bishops of*Philippians 1:1*are likely to be understood as the elders appointed by Paul upon his leaving this mission station.\n\nIt is clear that church government in the NT period was still relatively fluid, but the seeds for the later structures were surely planted. The institution of the elders, on the basis of Jewish precedent, was central. The episcopate (overseers/bishops) probably emerged out of the presbyterian (elders), one elder being appointed as overseer by the entire council of elders.\n\n*See also**Bishop*;*Deacon, Deaconess*;*Pastor*;*Presbyter*;*Spiritual Gifts*.\n\n
Faith	FAITH\n\nBelief in that which has no tangible proof; trust in God.\n\nDefinition of Faith\n\nIn the OT and NT, “faith” carries several meanings. It may mean simple trust in God or in the Word of God, and at other times faith almost becomes equivalent to active obedience. It may also find expression in the affirmation of a creedal statement. Thus, it also comes to mean the entire body of received Christian teaching or truth—“the truth.” In*Colossians 2:7*, the term suggests something to be accepted as a whole and embodied in personal life. In*2 Timothy 4:7*, Paul witnesses to having “kept the faith.”\n\nFaith in the Old Testament\n\nThe OT also strongly emphasizes faith as confidence in God’s covenant or in the covenant God made with Abraham and his descendants. The call of Abraham and the promise that his descendants would be used in the history of redemption became the basis of the narratives of the OT, being seen as the working out of that covenant. Once the nation Israel was brought into being, God sustained and protected it. The exodus from Egypt is a prominent indication that God was at work restoring his people to the Promised Land. The obedience of the people of God as the proper expression of faith is seen clearly in the OT. Without seeing God, his people believed and obeyed him. Abraham left his native land to go into unknown territory. The people of Israel left Egypt following the leadership of God to a land they could not see. The promise of God gave them courage to possess the land promised to them. After the exodus, the covenant of Abraham was confirmed with the people of Israel by the sprinkling of blood (*Ex 24:6-7*). There was to be strict obedience to God’s commands as an expression of faith. This response of human faith to the Lord’s faithfulness was national and collective. There also were commands to, and instances of, personal faith.\n\nNot only the narrative and legal portions of the OT but also the poetic and prophetic writings emphasize faith. The Psalms abound in expressions of personal confidence in the Lord even in dark times. Habakkuk points out that “the righteous shall live by his faith” (*Hb 2:4*). From such instances it is clear that, as the Lord’s education of Israel proceeded, the matter of faith in God’s faithfulness became more and more a matter of individual and personal response, and it is in the Prophets that several ingredients—such as trust, obedience, fear, and certainty—blend into the understanding of such personal faith.\n\nFaith in the New Testament\n\nAs over against the OT, where the accent is on the faithfulness of God, in the NT the emphasis is placed on the active, responding faith of the hearer to the promised, final revelation in the Messiah, Jesus. Both verb and noun regularly describe the adequate response of people to Jesus’ word and to the gospel.\n\nThe Synoptic Gospels\n\nThe most striking feature of the synoptic Gospels (quoted below from thersv) is the use of faith without identifying its object: “If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed” (*Mt 17:20*); “When Jesus saw their faith” (*Mk 2:5*); “Your faith has saved you” (*Lk 7:50*). Jesus is portrayed as one who by his work and word opens the door to faith and makes faith possible. The question is not whether the faith is in Jesus or in the Father; the implication is undoubtedly both, but as with every true bearer of the Word of God, the eye of faith is turned to the One who sends.\n\nOn more than one occasion, Jesus denies the request for a miracle to substantiate his words (*Mt 12:38-39*;*16:1-4*). Faith is response to the Word alone without any supporting props. No sign is to be given but the sign of Jonah. In the story of the rich man and Lazarus (*Lk 16:19-31*), Jesus denies the request for the spectacular and insists that the hearer must respond to the word given to him (cf.*Jn 20:29*). The Word demands self-surrender and commitment. Hence, the very nature of the Word and of faith becomes an obstacle to the proud and the powerful.\n\nFaith is the medium by which the power of God is made visible. It moves mountains, heals the sick, and is the means of entrance into the kingdom. It may be mingled with doubt, as with the father who sought healing for his son (“I believe; help my unbelief!” [*Mk 9:24*]), or as with John the Baptist in prison, who, even with his doubts, was confirmed by Jesus as the greatest of the offspring of woman (*Mt 11:2-15*). Peter’s (and the other disciples’) perception was faulty, but Jesus affirms Peter’s confession as the foundation stone of the church. The synoptic Gospels portray the early faith of the disciples in all its limitations and weaknesses, yet it is still faith in that it is their positive response to Jesus’ word and work.\n\nThe Fourth Gospel\n\nFaith is an especially significant concept in the Gospel of John (quoted below from thersv), though the word (in the Greek) occurs only as a verb. Quite often the reference has to do with the acceptance that something is true, that is, simple credence, or belief: “Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father in me” (*Jn 14:11*); “If you believed Moses, you would believe me” (*Jn 5:46*).\n\nEven more significant is the special expression “to believe into” in the sense of putting one’s trust into another. The particular form of the expression is without parallel before the fourth Gospel and may well express the strong sense of personal trust in the eternal Word made flesh. In*John 3:16*, whoever puts trust in him has eternal life. Those who put their trust in him are given power to become sons of God—to be born of God (*Jn 1:12*). They will never thirst (*6:35*); they will live, even though they die (*11:25*).\n\nIn other places, John speaks of trust or faith in an absolute sense, that is, without referring to the one in whom trust is placed. In*John 11:15*Jesus arrives after the death of Lazarus and is glad “in order that you might believe.” The outcome is going to be faith. Similarly, in the prologue (*1:7*), John the Baptist bears witness in order that through him all might believe. As Jesus satisfies the doubt of Thomas concerning the resurrection, he says, “Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe” (*20:29*). In these and other passages the fundamental outcome of Jesus’ witness to himself is trust.\n\nFaith and knowledge are closely related. In*John 6:69*Peter says, “We have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God.” In his priestly prayer Jesus says that eternal life is to “know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent” (*Jn 17:3*). Also, God is seen through the eyes of faith. No one has ever seen God, but the Only Begotten has revealed him (*1:18*). He who has seen Jesus has seen the Father (*14:9*).\n\nTo believe is also expressed in the verb “receive.” Those who receive Christ are given power to become the sons of God (*Jn 1:12*). Trust is that form of knowing or seeing by which the glory of God (*1:14*;*17:4*) is made present.\n\nPaul’s Writings\n\nIn Paul’s letters (quoted below from thersv), he writes about faith from a number of angles. He sets faith over against “works of the law” as the only and true basis for righteousness (*Rom 1–4*;*Gal 1–4*) and appeals to Abraham to prove his point: “Abraham believed God and it was reckoned to him for righteousness” (*Gn 15:6*; cf.*Rom 4:5*;*Gal 3:6*). This is entirely apart from the law (*Rom 3:21*); righteousness is the gift of God through faith in Christ, specifically in his atoning work. Behind Paul’s conviction lies his awareness of the radical and pervasive sinfulness of humans that renders each one helpless. Humanity is dead in sin but is made alive by faith in the word and work of Jesus mediated through the gospel.\n\nFaith, then, is faith in Jesus Christ. The number of metaphors Paul employs to describe the consequences of faith is staggering. It is by faith that believers are justified (*Rom 5:1*), reconciled (*2 Cor 5:18*), redeemed (*Eph 1:7*), made alive (*2:5*), adopted into the family of God (*Rom 8:15-16*), re-created (*2 Cor 5:17*), transported into a new kingdom (*Col 1:13*), and set free (*Gal 5:1*). Faith is, for Paul, the*sine qua non*of every aspect of salvation, from the grace that convicts to the receiving of the full inheritance at the coming of the Lord.\n\nIn Paul’s letters, faith is bound up with love so that the great exponent of justification by faith becomes also the articulate exponent of distinctive Christian love. To say that faith is indispensable to salvation is only part of the truth, for faith expresses itself through love: “For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is of any avail, but faith working through love” (*Gal 5:6*); “If I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing” (*1 Cor 13:2*). Love is both the genesis and the ultimate expression of faith. Hence, even for Paul there can be no*total*separation between faith and works. This love of which Paul speaks is the essential fruit of the Spirit through whom the life of faith is lived. Only by virtue of the indwelling Spirit does faith find expression in love.\n\nGeneral Epistles\n\nJames speaks of faith as being completed by works (*Jas 2:22*). He opposed that concept of faith that thinks primarily of creedal assent, of believing that something is true without acting upon it. James, like Paul, assumes the primacy of faith, but he is warning against those who would draw wrong conclusions. Faith apart from works is not faith; it is barren (v*20*). The practical dimension of faith is the burden of much of this epistle.\n\nThe writer of Hebrews recognizes that faith has always been characteristic of the people of God and their specially called leaders. Faith makes substantial what is otherwise nebulous and uncertain; it makes evidential what is not visible. By faith the people of God have a more certain ground for their lives and their actions than the world is able to discern (*Heb 11:1*). The great cloud of witnesses (*12:1*) bear testimony by their faith to the faithfulness of God.\n\nFaith is opened up by the Word of God, finds expression through the Holy Spirit who is given, and bears witness to the lordship of Jesus Christ.\n\n
Glory	GLORY\n\nThe singular splendor of God and the consequences for humanity.\n\nThe Glory of God\n\nThe glory of God can be described in two senses: (1) as a general category or attribute, and (2) as a specific category referring to particular historical manifestations of his presence.\n\nAs an Attribute\n\nGod’s glory refers primarily to his majestic beauty and splendor; it also refers to the expression of God’s character (*Rom 3:23*). The Scriptures record praise to his glorious name (*Neh 9:5*), describe him as the glorious Father (*Eph 1:17*) and the King of glory (*Ps 24*); he is exalted above the heavens, and his glory is over all the earth (*Pss 57:5, 11*;*108:5*;*113:4*). He is the God of glory who appeared to the patriarchs of the OT (*Acts 7:2*). He is jealous to maintain his glory and unwilling that it be given to another (*Is 42:8*); he acts to bring glory to himself (*Ps 79:9*;*Is 48:11*).\n\nThe glory of God is proclaimed by the Creation (*Pss 19:1*;*97:6*;*Rom 1:20*). It is revealed by his mighty acts of salvation and deliverance (*1 Chr 16:24*;*Pss 72:18-19*;*96:3*;*145:10-12*;*Jn 11:4, 40*). His glory is the theme of the praise (*1 Chr 16:24-29*;*Pss 29:1-2, 9*;*66:1-2*;*96:7-8*;*115:1*;*Is 42:12*;*Rom 4:20*;*Phil 2:9-11*).\n\nAs His Presence\n\nReferences to the glory of the Lord are often to particular historical manifestations of his presence; images of light and fire are prominently associated with these occurrences. The foremost example is what is known in rabbinical literature as the shekinah glory, a phrase meaning the “dwelling glory.” It refers primarily to the presence of God in the pillar of cloud and fire in the OT.\n\nThe first explicit reference to the glory cloud is found in*Exodus 13:21-22*. At the time of the exodus, the glory of God appeared in the pillar of cloud and fire to lead the people through the sea and wilderness (*Neh 9:11-12, 19*). At Sinai, with Israel encamped around the mountain, the glory of God comes in the cloud and fire to speak with Moses in the sight of the people (*Ex 19:9, 16-18*;*24:15-18*;*Dt 5:5, 22-24*). When Moses is given a glimpse of that glory unconcealed by the cloud and fire, his own face becomes radiant and must be veiled because of the people’s fear (*Ex 33:18-23*;*34:29-35*;*2 Cor 3:7-18*).\n\nThe picture of Israel encamped around the glory of God on Sinai portrays God dwelling in the midst of his people. When the tabernacle is completed and the people set out on their march, the glory cloud of God’s presence dwells above them throughout their journey (*Ex 40:34-38*;*Nm 10:11-12*). When they encamp, the tribes encircle the tabernacle (*Nm 1:50–2:2*), and the cloud reminds them of his presence in their midst. Later, the same glory filled the new temple that Solomon builds (*2 Chr 5:13–6:1*;*7:1-3*). The psalmists celebrated Jerusalem and the temple as the place where his glory dwelt (*Pss 26:8*;*63:2*;*85:9*); God was in their midst.\n\nLater in Israel’s history they denied God’s glorious presence (*Is 3:8*) and exchanged the glory of the Lord for idols made by human hands (*Ps 106:20*;*Jer 2:10-11*; cf.*Rom 1:23*). Because of their disobedience, judgment came against Jerusalem; the penalties of covenant violation were enforced. God would no longer be the God of a disobedient people (*Hos 1:9*). God’s presence in the glory cloud left the temple (*Ez 10:4, 18-19*;*11:22*), and Israel went into exile (*12:1-15*).\n\nYet out of this judgment God determined to bring a remnant to rebuild the city and the temple. In his visions Ezekiel saw the glory of the Lord return to dwell in the temple again (*Ez 43:2-9*), a time when the glory would return to a purified people and dwell among them forever. When the exile was over and the second temple was under construction, Haggai and Zechariah urged the people on with the promise of the return of the glory of God to fill the temple as it had done in the first temple and to “be glory in their midst” (*Hg 2:3-9*;*Zec 2:5, 10-11*).\n\nThe Glory of God in Jesus Christ\n\nWe are not told if the shekinah glory returned to the second temple. But we are told that God’s glory was seen again on earth in the person of Jesus Christ.*John 1:14*says, “The Word became flesh and*dwelt*among us, and we beheld his*glory, glory*as of the only Son” (italics added). As such, Jesus was the new tabernacle for God’s abiding glory. In Jesus, God dwelt among people. Since Christ was (and is) the very image of God, to see the light of his face was to know the glory of God (*2 Cor 4:4-6*). To see Jesus was to see a “light to the Gentiles and the glory of Israel” (*Lk 2:30-32*). The disciples who witnessed the Transfiguration (*Mt 17:1-8*) saw his glory in a marvelous way (*2 Pt 1:16-17*), for it was a glory that burst out of his human body. This outburst of glory prefigured the glorification Christ experienced in resurrection and ascension (see*Jn 17:5*;*Phil 2:5-11*).\n\nBecause Jesus humbled himself and was obedient to the point of death, God highly exalted him (*Phil 2:8-9*). After he suffered death on the cross, he entered into his glory (*Lk 24:26*) with a new and glorious body (*1 Cor 15:39-43*;*Phil 3:21*). The glorified Christ appeared to his servants. Stephen saw his glory (*Acts 7:55*), and Saul was blinded by his splendor (*9:3*). That same Christ is predicted to return in glory. He will sit on his throne in judgment (*Mt 25:31*); evil will be punished (*16:27*;*24:30*;*Mk 13:26*;*Lk 21:27*;*2 Thes 2:9-10*). Those who have professed him before men need not fear his glorious appearing (*Mk 8:38*).\n\nAt the consummation, the whole earth will be filled with his glory (*Ps 72:19*;*Is 6:3*;*Hb 2:14*). No longer will a glory cloud rest above a temple to mark the Holy Place, for there will be a new heaven and a new earth (*Rv 21:1*). The Holy City will have the radiance of the glory of God (vv*10-11*).\n\nGlory and the People of God\n\nThe people of God have experienced the glory of the presence of God. The glory cloud of the OT was*their*glory (*Ps 106:20*;*Jer 2:11*). Christ came as the embodiment of the glory of God; God was in the midst of his people. When Christ ascended, he sent his Spirit to the believers (*Jn 16:7-14*) so that God could live in the midst of his people. The Spirit of glory rests on those who suffer for the name of Christ (*1 Pt 4:14*); that Spirit is the guarantee of the glorious inheritance of the saints (*Rom 8:16-17*).\n\nGod has given to his people the hope of glory (*Rom 5:2*;*Phil 3:21*;*Col 1:27*;*Jude 1:24-25*). Those whom he has chosen he will also glorify (*Rom 8:30*;*9:23*); they will share in the glory of Christ (*Col 3:4*;*2 Thes 2:14*;*2 Tm 2:10*). The sufferings of this age do not compare with the glory that will be revealed (*Rom 8:18*;*2 Cor 4:17*). The whole of creation longs to see the glorious freedom of the children of God (*Rom 8:21*). This hope of glory is so certain that Peter can speak of participating in it even now (*1 Pt 5:1*) while looking forward to that eternal glory (v*10*). As partakers in the glory of Christ, the church is called to glorify God. Because of the hope that is in them, they purify themselves (*1 Jn 3:3*).\n\n*See also**Boast*;*God, Being and Attributes of*;*Pillar of Fire and Cloud*;*Shekinah*;*Theophany*;*Wealth*.\n\n
Gospel	GOSPEL\n\nWord derived from the Anglo-Saxon*godspell*denoting “glad tidings” or “good news.”\n\nPreview\n\n• *The Gospel Message of Isaiah*\n\n• *The Gospel in the New Testament*\n\n• *The Good News of Christ’s Coming*\n\n• *The Gospel according to Jesus*\n\n• *The Gospel after Jesus’ Resurrection*\n\nThe Gospel Message of Isaiah\n\nOf all the passages cited, those of Isaiah provide the most important background for the gospel in the NT. According to Isaiah’s gospel, it is God alone who saves, and there is no explanation for his saving action except in his own nature. Israel’s deliverance is undeserved; she is no more worthy of the divine love now than when she went into captivity. In whatever measure she has paid the just due for her past sins (*Is 40:2*), she remains a sinful people (*42:25*;*46:12-13*;*48:1*). It is only by God’s grace that she is saved (*55:1-7*). By God’s design, Israel’s salvation depends not upon her own righteousness but upon his (*41:10*;*45:24*;*46:13*;*51:5-6*). There being no righteousness to reward, the Lord acts to*create*righteousness in Israel (*45:8*;*61:3, 10-11*). Yet as these references indicate, salvation is not accomplished at the expense of justice. The penalty for Israel’s sins is to be paid in full. God’s mercy is not hereby called into question. On the contrary, it is precisely here that his mercy is most poignantly expressed, for the penalty is exacted not from his people but from the Servant appointed to stand in their place (*53:4-12*). Through the Servant’s work, many shall be justified (*53:11*). The coming of the Evangelist—the preacher of the good news—is predicted in*Isaiah 61*. He is called the anointed One (v*1*) who proclaims the year of the Lord’s favor (v*2*). God will be glorified through his preaching (v*3*).\n\nThe Gospel in the New Testament\n\nIn only two places (*Gal 3:8*;*Heb 4:2, 6*) does the NT speak of the proclamation of the gospel prior to the Christian era. This is quite remarkable, given (1) the unmistakable presence of the gospel in the OT, (2) the extent of gospel terminology in the NT (in the Greek the noun appears 76 times; and the verb, 54), and (3) the fact that the NT presents Christ as the fulfillment of the OT and draws heavily on the OT to interpret his person and work. Not only is it remarkable; it is very significant. It indicates that the NT usage depends not only upon the*character*of the message (truth about salvation) but also upon*historical events.*Almost without exception, the NT restricts its application of gospel terminology to proclamations made during the time of fulfillment—the age in which the salvation promised in the OT is actually accomplished. The NT is preoccupied, not with promises of salvation, but with news of salvation. According to*Mark 1:1-4*, the gospel “begins” not in the OT but with John the Baptist, in whose work OT prophecy is fulfilled. In*Romans 1:1-5*the gospel is represented as a blessing promised in the OT but not actually given until Jesus comes (see also*Acts 13:32-33*).\n\nThe Good News of Christ’s Coming\n\nThe promised birth of John the Baptist is good news (*Lk 1:19*), not only for his parents (vv*7, 24-25*) but for all the people: John is sent to prepare them for Messiah’s coming (vv*14-17, 67-79*). John’s own preaching is gospel (*3:18*) for the same reason. The Messiah would be coming to execute judgment, a process that involves both condemnation and salvation (vv*3-17*). John’s message is gospel for sinners in that they are warned of impending doom and urged to repent before the ax falls (vv*7-9*); it is gospel for the repentant in that they are promised forgiveness (v*3*) and membership in Messiah’s community (v*17*). The birth of the Savior himself is announced as good news bringing great joy (*2:10-11*).\n\nThe Gospel according to Jesus\n\nThe Coming of the Kingdom of God\n\nJesus was authorized by God and anointed by the Spirit to proclaim the gospel (*Mk 1:14*;*Lk 4:18*). At the heart of his preaching stands the announcement “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent, and believe in the gospel” (*Mk 1:15*). (For further references to this gospel, see*Mt 4:23*;*9:35*;*24:14*;*26:13*;*Mk 8:35*;*10:29*;*13:10*;*14:9*;*Lk 4:43*;*8:1*;*16:16*.) The message is good news for several reasons: (1) The kingdom is coming. The God whom Jesus proclaims is sovereign over all he has made. Yet paradoxically his rule is incomplete: his will is not done on earth as it is in heaven; wrong, not right, prevails. But these conditions are not final, according to Jesus. With the coming of the kingdom, God’s rule will be completed; wrong will be judged, righteousness established, and his people blessed. (2) The kingdom is*now*being inaugurated. “The time is fulfilled,” declares Jesus (*Mk 1:15a*). The time appointed for the fulfillment of the OT promises has arrived. (3) The consummation of the kingdom is therefore no longer a distant prospect; the full realization of God’s rule is “at hand” (*Mk 1:15b*). (4) God is establishing his rule for a saving purpose. This is implied in Jesus’ call to repentance (*Mk 1:15c*). It is especially clear in the passages to which we now turn.\n\nThe Salvation of the Poor\n\nInvited to read the Scripture in the synagogue at Nazareth, Jesus turns to*Isaiah 61*: “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed, to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord” (*Lk 4:18-19*,rsv). Having read the prophecy, Jesus announces its fulfillment in his own ministry (v*21*). Included among those whom Jesus has come to free are the physically infirm, such as the blind (v*18*) and the leprous (v*27*) (cf. the references to healing miracles in vv*23, 33-41*; the close connection between evangelizing and healing in*Mt 4:23*;*9:35*;*11:5*;*Lk 7:21-22*;*9:6*; and the description in*Mt 12:22-29*;*Lk 13:11-16*, of the physically afflicted as captives of Satan now liberated by Jesus). Also included are the materially poor—people like the widow helped by Elijah during the famine (*Lk 4:25-26*). It is the literally poor and hungry whom Jesus pronounces “blessed” in*Luke 6:20-21*. Yet it is primarily “spiritual” poverty that is in view. Still applying*Isaiah 61*, Jesus speaks in*Matthew 5:3*of the “poor in spirit.” These are people broken and grieved by misery and poverty, oppression and injustice, suffering and death, national apostasy and personal sin—people who in their extremity turn to God and longingly wait for him to bring forth justice, bestow his mercy, and establish his kingdom. It is to just such people that Jesus brings good news (*Mt 5:3-10*). God sent him to usher in the kingdom, to rescue the lost, to liberate the enslaved, to cure the afflicted, to bind up hearts that are broken, and to forgive the guilty (*Mk 2:5, 10, 17*;*10:45*;*Lk 4:18-21*;*7:48-49*;*15:1-32*;*19:10*).\n\nThe Gift of Grace\n\nThe coming of the kingdom is not the effect or the reward of human effort but God’s answer to the human predicament—the gift of his favor (*Lk 12:32*). Correspondingly, the explanation for the salvation of the poor lies nowhere but in God’s own character. As the prodigal himself recognized, he hardly deserved to be his father’s servant, much less his son. Nothing he did, not even his repentance, accounted for the father’s love (*15:11-32*). In the parable of*Matthew 20:1-16*, it is owing entirely to the goodness of the employer that the last workers to be hired receive a full day’s wages. The first debtor in the story of*Matthew 18:23-35*earned nothing but the right to be sold into slavery; instead, the king canceled his enormous debt. The publican, who had nothing to offer God but a confession of sin and plea for mercy, went home justified (*Lk 18:13-14*). The same holds true for the more virtuous among the poor, such as the persons described in*Matthew 5:7-10*. Their virtue is real, not imagined. Yet in keeping God’s commands, they do not put him in their debt; they are simply doing their duty (*Lk 17:7-10*). Furthermore, even the most merciful need divine mercy (*Mt 5:7*). For even those most zealous to obey God’s law are unable to fulfill all its requirements (cf.*11:28-30*). The first servant in*Matthew 18:23-35*owes far more money than someone in such a situation could possibly pay—which serves to magnify the generosity of the king. Grace depends for its exercise upon the inability of its objects (*Lk 14:12-14*).\n\nThe Call to Salvation\n\nThe Israelites are without exception a sinful people, all of them needing the salvation that Jesus brings (*Mt 1:21*;*Lk 1:77*). In demonstration of God’s grace, Jesus proclaimed his gospel to the entire nation (*Mt 4:23*;*9:35*;*15:24*;*Lk 4:43*;*9:6*;*20:1*). From the most respectable to the least, all are summoned to submit to God’s rule, all are invited to come and partake freely of the banquet he has spread (*Lk 14:16-24*). But the gift of salvation must be received if it is to be experienced (*Mk 10:15*). And while it is indeed a gift that costs nothing, it is also a priceless treasure for which a wise person will freely sacrifice everything else (*Mt 13:44-46*), a sacrifice exceeded only by the cost of rejecting the gospel (*Mt 11:20-24*;*Mk 8:34-39*;*Lk 14:24, 33*). “Repent and believe in the gospel,” Jesus commands (*Mk 1:15*). The self-righteous and the self-sufficient must be jolted out of their false sense of security and humbly recognize their need for God (*Lk 6:24-26*). Only then will Jesus’ message to the poor be seen as gospel. An announcement of liberation (*4:18-19*) is good news only to people who are enslaved and know they are. The command applies also to the destitute and the afflicted. Those among them who bemoan their lot must repent of their sins. But something further is needed for the response to be complete: a person cannot believe Jesus’ gospel without a commitment to the*Person*of Christ (*Jn 3:16*). Even those who are already “poor in spirit,” in the sense defined earlier, are not really “blessed” until they acknowledge the truth of Jesus’ claims (*Mt 11:6*) and commit themselves to a life of obedience on his terms (*7:21-27*). This prepares us for the next point.\n\nSummary\n\nThroughout Jesus’ earthly ministry, the theme of his gospel remains the dawning of God’s kingdom (*Mt 4:23*;*24:14*;*Lk 4:43*;*16:16*), a message that is preached almost exclusively to Jews (*Mt 10:5-6*;*15:24*). Yet Jesus also provides glimpses into what the gospel was to become once his work on earth was accomplished: (1) In*Mark 8:35*and*10:29*Jesus speaks of individuals who needed to make great sacrifices “for my sake and for the gospel.” While distinguished from each other, the person of Jesus and the gospel are here associated in the closest possible way. The time was approaching when the Proclaimer of the gospel would become the Proclaimed. (2) In*Mark 13:10*and*Matthew 24:14*(and the textually doubtful*Mk 16:15*) Jesus foretells the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom to the gentile nations. (3) In*Mark 14*, having interpreted a woman’s action (v *3*) as an anointing of his body beforehand for burial (v*8*), Jesus declares, “And truly, I say to you, wherever the gospel is preached in the whole world, what she has done will be told in memory of her” (v*9*,rsv; cf.*Mt 26:13*). This statement strongly implies that both the person of Jesus and the event of his death will figure prominently in the message that is to be proclaimed; otherwise, it is strange that the gospel and this particular act should be so solemnly bound together. Thus, here in the text already is an indication of how crucial Jesus’ death is both for the provision of the salvation announced in his gospel (cf.*Mk 14:22-24*) and for the launching of the evangelistic mission to the Gentiles (*Mt 20:28*is vital for explaining the shift from*Mt 15:24*to*28:18-20*).\n\nThe Gospel after Jesus’ Resurrection\n\nAfter the resurrection of Jesus, the gospel was proclaimed by his eyewitnesses. The contents of this gospel are recorded in the book of Acts and in Paul’s letters. Of the 43 instances ofeuangelizomai(“evangelize”) beyond the Gospels, 15 occur in Acts and 21 in Paul’s writings; of the 64 instances ofeuangelion(“gospel”), 2 occur in Acts and no fewer than 60 in Paul.\n\nThe Gospel of Christ\n\nHaving risen from the dead, Jesus Christ again evangelizes (*Eph 2:16-17*), doing so now through his appointed representatives (*Rom 15:16-18*;*1 Cor 1:17*;*9:12-18*;*Gal 4:13-14*;*Eph 4:11*;*2 Tm 1:9-11*). More than that, Christ has become the central theme of the gospel; the Proclaimer is now the Proclaimed. This is repeatedly affirmed in Acts (*5:42*;*8:4-5, 35*;*11:20*;*17:18*) and in Paul’s writings (*Rom 1:1-4*;*10:8-17*;*15:19-20*;*2 Cor 4:4-6*;*11:4*;*Gal 1:16*;*Eph 3:8*;*Phil 1:15-18*;*2 Tm 2:8*). The NT always speaks of*the gospel*—never the gospels—of Christ. A second gospel is as inconceivable and as unnecessary as a second Christ. This is the one gospel that God authorizes (e.g.,*Rom 1:1-17*) and proclaims (e.g.,*2 Thes 2:13-14*).*Galatians 2:7-9*speaks not of two gospels but of two mission fields. Paul (the apostle to the uncircumcised) and Peter (the apostle to the circumcised) are both entrusted with “the gospel of Christ” (*Gal 1:7*; cf.*1 Cor 15:1-11*), the message that God has ordained for the salvation of Jews and Gentiles alike (*Rom 1:16*). The “different gospel” that Paul denounces in*Galatians 1:6-9*and*2 Corinthians 11:4*is not another gospel about Jesus but a message about “another Jesus”—not the real one, but one who exists only in the minds and the messages of those who proclaim him. To preach the true Christ is to preach the true gospel, however questionable one’s motives (*Phil 1:15-18, 27*), and to respond rightly to the gospel is to turn to Christ (*Acts 11:20-21*;*Rom 10:8-17*;*Gal 2:14-16*).\n\nThe Gospel as a Witness to Saving Events\n\nThe gospel bears witness to every aspect of Christ’s saving work, from his birth (*Rom 1:3*;*2 Tm 2:8*) and public ministry (*Mk 1:1*;*Acts 10:36-38*) to his second coming (*Col 1:5, 23*; cf.*3:1-4*;*1 Thes 1:5-10*) and the last judgment (*Rom 2:16*). But it is the death and the resurrection of Christ that are most crucial for the accomplishment of salvation, and that are therefore most prominent in the gospel’s witness. These are the events with which Mark’s proclamation climaxes (chs*15–16*), and for which everything else prepares (*8:31*;*9:31*;*10:33-34*;*12:6-8*); special stress is placed upon Jesus’ death as the means of salvation from sin (*10:45*;*14:3-9, 22-24*). In Paul’s gospel, too, the death and resurrection of Jesus are central (*Rom 4:25*;*1 Cor 15:1-4*), with the cross occupying the very center (*1 Cor 1:17–2:5*). Had Christ not risen from the dead, Paul argues, the preaching of the cross would be a waste of time (*1 Cor 15:14, 17*; cf.*Rom 6:3-11*). However, now that Christ has risen, his death deserves special emphasis as the place where God provides atonement for sins (*Rom 3:21-26*;*5:6-11*;*2 Cor 5:14-21*;*Eph 1:7*). The gospel according to Acts proclaims Jesus’ death (*Acts 8:25*;*20:24, 28*; cf.*10:36-43*) and preeminently his resurrection, the event by which he conquered death and was exalted as Lord and coming Judge (*10:36-43*;*13:32-33*;*17:18, 31*). According to 1 Peter, the bearers of the gospel (*1 Pt 1:12*) concentrated, as had the OT prophets, on “the sufferings of Christ and the subsequent glory” (*1:11*; cf.*1:18-19*;*2:21-24*;*3:18-22*).\n\nThe Gospel as a Power for Salvation\n\nThe gospel is much more than a report of past events and an exposition of doctrine. Paul declares in*1 Corinthians 1:17-18*and again in*Romans 1:16*that the gospel is “the power of God”—not merely a witness to his power but an*expression*of his power. Thus, it cannot be fettered (*2 Tm 2:8-9*). “Our gospel came to you not only in word, but also in power,” Paul writes in*1 Thessalonians 1:5*. His point is not that the gospel was accompanied by mighty works (though this happened; cf.*Rom 15:18-19*), but that the gospel itself is a mighty work. God makes it so through his Holy Spirit (*Rom 15:18-19*;*1 Cor 2:1-5*;*1 Thes 1:6*). Furthermore, God’s singular purpose in exercising his power is to change people’s lives, to liberate them from sin and death, and to reconcile them to himself—in short, to save them. The gospel has power to effect the salvation it announces and to impart the life it promises (e.g.,*Rom 1:16*;*10:8-17*;*1 Cor 1:17-18*;*15:1-2*;*Eph 1:13*;*2 Thes 2:13-14*;*2 Tm 1:8-11*;*1 Pt 1:23-25*). If people are to experience salvation, they must hear and believe the gospel. It is precisely in and through this message that the saving power manifested in the person and work of Christ (especially in his death and resurrection) is conveyed to men and made effective in their lives. Similarly it is in association with the gospel, or as a direct result of the reception of the gospel, that the Holy Spirit is imparted to believers (*Acts 10:36-44*;*15:7-8*;*2 Cor 11:4*;*Gal 3:1-2*). In short, the gospel is the decisive place of encounter between the sinner and God the Savior.\n\nThe Gospel of Grace\n\nAccording to Peter’s testimony at the Jerusalem Council (*Acts 15:7-11*), an essential part of the gospel—for Gentiles and Jews alike—is salvation “through the grace of the Lord Jesus.” Toward the close of his missionary career, Paul states that his basic concern has been “to testify to the gospel of the grace of God” (*Acts 20:24*,rsv). This statement can be understood only in relation to Paul’s concept of the righteousness of God, particularly as set forth in Romans. Paul is here not merely expounding a divine attribute. Rather, he is dramatizing a divine activity—the manifestation of God’s righteousness now, “in the present time” (*Rom 3:26*), in the new age inaugurated by the coming of Jesus. The manifestation is twofold. Viewing the two aspects together, and doing so in the light of the gospel declared by Isaiah and by Jesus (both of whom strongly influenced Paul), respectively, will help us to understand why Paul speaks of “the gospel of the grace of God.”\n\nFirst, the gospel is a*witness*to God’s grace. In offering his Son as a sacrifice for sins (*Rom 3:25a*), God demonstrates his righteousness (vv*25b-26*). That is, in the death of Jesus sins formerly “passed over” (v*25*c) become the object of God’s wrath (cf.*1:18*) and judgment. Yet in the very place where God deals justly and decisively with sins, he shows his grace to sinners. For the judgment against sin is focused not upon the sinners themselves but upon the One appointed to act on their behalf and to stand in their place (*Rom 4:25*;*5:6, 11*; cf.*2 Cor 5:21*;*Gal 3:13*). On this basis, sinners are freely pardoned (*Rom 3:24*). “The grace of the Lord Jesus” (*Acts 15:11*) toward the sinful is also in evidence, for he willingly bears their iniquities and suffers the consequences of their wrongdoing (*Gal 2:20*; cf.*2 Cor 8:9*;*Phil 2:6-8*).\n\nSecond, the gospel is a*channel*of God’s grace. “The righteousness of God is revealed” in the gospel, says Paul (*Rom 1:17*). By this he means, not that the gospel talks about the righteousness of God (though it does), but that God’s righteousness is actively at work in the gospel. This activity in turn explains how the gospel becomes “the power of God for salvation” (v*16*). And just how does God demonstrate his righteousness at this stage? In short, by bestowing it as a free gift on sinful human beings. It remains the righteousness of God, but by God’s grace, it is a righteousness in which humans may share. Furthermore, partaking of God’s righteousness depends on being personally united with Jesus Christ. In Paul’s view the saved person is one who has been acquitted, justified, “declared righteous” by God the judge. The basis for the verdict is not that I in myself am righteous (God justifies the ungodly,*Rom 4:5*). Nor does God treat me as though I were righteous. According to Paul I am declared righteous because I really*am*righteous—not in myself but in Christ (*1 Cor 1:30*;*2 Cor 5:21*;*Phil 3:9*). This union is established through the revelation—and the free offer—of God’s righteousness in the gospel (*Rom 1:16-17*).\n\nResponding to the Gospel\n\nThe gospel calls for a threefold response:\n\n1.*Believing.*The gospel, says Paul, is “the power of God for salvation to every one who has faith” (*Rom 1:16*). For Paul, faith is the abandonment of all reliance upon “works of law” for justification (*3:28*) and utter dependence upon the grace of God as demonstrated in the work of Christ, especially his death (v*25*). Accordingly, the “different gospel” of*Galatians 1:6*and*2 Corinthians 11:4*is spurious, for it preaches salvation by personal merit rather than (or together with) the work of Christ (cf.*Gal 2:16*). Ultimately faith rests upon God (*Rom 4:24*;*1 Thes 1:8-9*) and upon Christ (*Rom 3:22, 26*;*Gal 2:16, 20*). Yet it is imperative that one believe the gospel also (*Acts 8:12*;*11:20-21*;*15:7*;*Rom 1:16*;*10:8-17*;*1 Cor 1:17-24*;*Phil 1:27*;*Heb 4:2*), for it is just by this means that God’s salvation is made known and mediated. Moreover, believing the gospel entails repentance (*Acts 14:15*;*20:21, 24*;*1 Thes 1:5-10*) and obedience (*Rom 1:5*;*15:16-18*;*Heb 4:6*). Those who refuse to obey the gospel are imperiling their lives (*2 Thes 1:5-10*;*1 Pt 4:17*).\n\n2.*Growing.*The Gospel is more than a message to be received—it is also a place in which to stand (*1 Cor 15:1-2*). It is sustainer of life as well as giver of life. One grows as a Christian not by turning from the gospel to other things (to turn away from the gospel is to abandon God and Christ,*Gal 1:6*), but by going ever more deeply into the gospel. In*Romans 1:15*Paul expresses his eagerness to proclaim the gospel to the Christians in Rome. In the following chapters, anticipating his visit, he offers one of his most profound expositions of the gospel—one whose truth has never been fathomed and whose power has never been exhausted.\n\n3.*Hoping.*“The hope of the gospel” (*Col 1:23*) includes not only the return of Christ and the glory of heaven (*Col 1:5*;*3:1-4*;*2 Thes 2:14-16*) but the final judgment as well. For those who embrace the gospel, the last judgment holds no terrors, because the Judge is the very one who rescues them from the wrath to come (*1 Thes 1:10*). Those who are united to him need not dread condemnation now or at the end (*Rom 8:1*). Instead, the last judgment will mark their final vindication (*1 Cor 4:5*;*Gal 5:5*). Accordingly, this theme is not just a corollary but an integral part of the Good News (*Rom 2:16*). Those who have died since believing the gospel (*1 Pt 4:6*) may seem to have suffered a fate common to all people, or even the condemnation reserved for the lawless; in fact, their response to the gospel assures them of approval by the coming Lord (*4:5-6*;*5:4*) and of a share in the imperishable inheritance of heaven (*1:4*).\n\n
Grace	GRACE\n\nThe gift of God as expressed in his actions of extending mercy, loving-kindness, and salvation to people.\n\nGrace is the dimension of divine activity that enables God to confront human indifference and rebellion with an inexhaustible capacity to forgive and to bless. God is gracious in action. The doctrine of divine grace underlies the thought of both the OT and NT. However, the OT merely anticipates and prepares for the full expression of grace that becomes manifest in the NT.\n\nGrace in the Old Testament\n\nEarly in the narrative of the OT, God reveals himself as a “God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness” (*Ex 34:6*,rsv). As a result, it becomes possible for undeserving humans to approach him with the prayer, “If now I have found favor [or grace] in thy sight, O Lord, . . .” (*Ex 34:9*,rsv). Through divine initiative, human alienation from God is turned by him into a state of unmerited acceptance that opens the way for reconciliation and redemptive usefulness.\n\nDivine grace was already operative in the Garden of Eden when God responded to the debacle of the fall with the promise of redemption (*Gn 3:15*) and solicitous care rather than with abandonment or retributive annihilation. The call to Abraham was an extension of grace, not only to him as an individual, but through him as a means of universal outreach. As an inseparable part of God’s promise of individual blessing to Abraham and of a national blessing to his descendants, the indication was given that the individual and the national blessings would be instrumental in bringing about a universal blessing to “all the families of the earth” (*Gn 12:2-3*). Consequently, both the election of Abraham and the promise of universal blessing find expression in a God-given covenant, the object of which is to extend God’s grace to the whole human race. In a solemn confirmation of the promise to Abraham, God affirmed, “My covenant is with you, and you shall be the father of a multitude of nations. . . . And I will establish my covenant between me and you and your descendants after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant” (*Gn 17:4, 7*,rsv). This promise was to be understood as finding fulfillment on the basis of grace, not of race, so that it would become applicable to all Abraham’s offspring—not only to Jewish believers, his racial descendants, but also to his spiritual descendants, believers from all nations who profess a faith like Abraham’s (*Rom 4:16*). Thus, from the perspective of divine grace, the election of Abraham and of national Israel was not an end in itself. It was God’s plan for extending his redemptive designs to all believers, from all nations. In extending his grace to Abraham, God was establishing the beginnings of the church, the community of grace.\n\nThe divine particularism evidenced in the election of Abraham and in his becoming the recipient of God’s grace provides a model for the selection of all the individuals used by God in the history of redemption. Beyond the benefits of grace accorded to individuals such as Abraham, David, the prophets, and later the apostles, by virtue of their call, loomed the potential of their contributions to the fulfillment of the covenant of God on behalf of the community of those who share the faith of Abraham—the church. In the gracious dealings of God with Israel, with its patriarchs and its leaders, God was laying the basis for his outreach of grace to the church universal. God’s gracious interventions in the old covenant were intended to manifest the ultimacy of the church in his redemptive purposes. In the exercise of their ministries, the prophets of the old covenant knew that they were serving not themselves but the church (*1 Pt 1:10-12*).\n\nAs a transitional, mediatory expression of divine grace, the institutions of the old covenant possessed only a temporary validity that has been superseded by the ultimate manifestations of God’s grace in the new covenant (*Heb 8:6-7*). Consequently, the old covenant was to become obsolete and replaced by a new covenant that would display the full manifestation of God’s grace. The proverbial tension between law and grace becomes intelligible in this perspective. Like the election of racial Israel, the law (as one of the most visible institutions of the old covenant) was a temporary measure of divine grace accorded to anticipate and prepare the covenant of justification through grace by faith in Jesus Christ (*Gal 3:23-29*;*Heb 10:1*).\n\nGrace in the New Testament\n\nThe concept of grace defined as God’s active involvement on behalf of his people receives a sharper focus in the NT. Divine grace becomes embodied in the person of Jesus Christ, who demonstrates visibly the dynamic nature of God’s grace and fulfills in his ministry of redemption the old covenant promises relative to God’s gracious dealings with humanity (*Jn 1:14, 17*).\n\nGod’s grace manifested in Jesus Christ makes it possible for God to forgive sinners and to gather them in the church, the new covenant community. During his ministry, Jesus repeatedly pronounced the words of forgiveness on a great number of sinners and ministered God’s benevolent succor to a variety of desperate human needs. Through teachings such as the father’s forgiveness of the prodigal son and the search for the lost sheep, Jesus made it clear that he had come to seek and save those who were lost. But ultimately it was his redemptive death on the cross that opened wide the gate of salvation for repentant sinners to find access to God’s forgiving and restorative grace. This simple truth is formulated in the doctrine of justification by faith through grace (*Rom 3:23*;*Ti 3:7*). According to this teaching, God’s gracious provision of the substitutionary death of Christ enables him to pronounce a verdict of “just” or “not guilty” on repentant sinners and to include them in his eternal purposes. As a result, they enter into the realm of God’s gracious activity, which enables them to implement the process of individual sanctification in cooperation with the Holy Spirit.\n\nGod’s grace manifested in Jesus Christ also makes it possible for God to bestow on believers undeserved benefits that enrich their lives and unite them together in the church, the body of Christ. Their acceptance on the basis of grace endows them with a new status as children of God, members of the household of God, so that they relate to him as to their heavenly Father (*Gal 4:4-6*). Consequently, they become members of a community where race, class, and sex distinctions are irrelevant, since they all became equal inheritors of God’s age-long promise to Abraham of universal blessing (*3:28-29*). In order to enrich their individual lives and to assure the usefulness of their participation in the life of the new community, the Holy Spirit graciously energizes believers with a variety of gifts for the performance of ministries designed to benefit the church (*Rom 12:6-8*). Foremost among those ministries is that of apostle, itself closely linked to God’s gracious provision (*1:5*;*15:15-16*) since it combines with the ministry of the prophets of old to provide the foundational structure of the church (*Eph 2:20*). Because the riches of divine grace are freely lavished upon believers in their community life upon earth (*1:7-8*), the church translated into eternity will demonstrate, by its very existence, the immeasurable riches of God’s grace in Jesus Christ (*2:6*).\n\nFinally, God’s grace manifested in Jesus Christ makes it possible for God to cause believers to reflect his grace in their character and relationships. The irreducible condition for receiving God’s grace is humility (*Jas 4:6*;*1 Pt 5:5*). Such humility in relation to God enables believers to practice humility in regard to other people. From a position of grace, they can set aside selfishness and conceit in order to treat others with deference (*Phil 2:3-4*) in an attitude of mutual servanthood (*Eph 5:21*), and in a spirit of mutual forgiveness (*Mt 18:23-35*) so that even their communication can exhibit divine grace (*Col 4:6*). Since the grace of Jesus Christ constitutes the existential context of the lives and relationships of believers, they are exhorted not to pervert the grace of God into ungodly practice (*Jude 1:4*) but instead to grow in the grace of the Lord (*2 Pt 3:18*).\n\nThe essential meaning of grace in the Bible refers to God’s disposition to exercise goodwill toward his creatures. This favorable disposition of God finds its supreme expression in Jesus Christ. By its very definition, this grace is rendered fully accessible to all humans with no other precondition than a repentant desire to receive it (*Ti 2:11-12*). As a result, the human condition of alienation from God and from his purposes becomes replaced with access to the otherwise unapproachable majesty of God represented by a throne, so that his grace may become available to meet human need (*Heb 4:16*). The tragic alternative to receiving God’s grace is to remain in hopeless alienation or to pursue sterile attempts to merit God’s favor through human efforts doomed to futility (*Rom 1:21*). God’s unconditional acceptance of sinners may be conditioned only by their rejection of his acceptance.\n\nBecause Christ represents the fulfillment, the embodiment, and the dispenser of divine grace, the early Christians freely referred to God’s grace as “the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.” This grace was conceived as being so basic and so pervasive to their individual lives and to the existence of their communities of faith that they naturally coupled the traditional greeting of*shalom*(“peace”) with a reference to the grace of Jesus Christ. This is the reason for the ubiquitous repetition of numerous variations on the basic greeting formula found in almost every book of the NT, “The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all” (*2 Thes 3:18*).\n\n*See also**God, Being and Attributes of*;*Love*;*Mercy*.\n\n
Holiness	HOLINESS\n\nChief attribute of God and a quality to be developed in his people. “Holiness” and the adjective “holy” occur more than 900 times in the Bible. The primary OT word for holiness means “to cut” or “to separate.” Fundamentally, holiness is a cutting off or separation from what is unclean and a consecration to what is pure.\n\nIn the OT, holiness as applied to God signifies his transcendence over creation and the moral perfection of his character. God is holy in that he is utterly distinct from his creation and exercises sovereign majesty and power over it. His holiness is especially prominent in the Psalms (*47:8*) and the Prophets (*Ez 39:7*), where “holiness” emerges as a synonym for Israel’s God. Thus, Scripture ascribes to God the title “Holy” (*Is 57:15*), “Holy One” (*Jb 6:10*;*Is 43:15*), and “Holy One of Israel” (*Ps 89:18*;*Is 60:14*;*Jer 50:29*).\n\nIn the OT God’s holiness denotes that the Lord is separate from all that is evil and defiled (cf.*Jb 34:10*). His holy character is the standard of absolute moral perfection (*Is 5:16*). God’s holiness—his transcendent majesty and the purity of his character—are skillfully balanced in*Psalm 99*. Verses*1 through 3* portray God’s distance from the finite and earthbound, whereas verses*4*and*5*emphasize his separation from sin and evil.\n\nIn the OT God demanded holiness in the lives of his people. Through Moses, God said to the congregation of Israel, “You shall be holy; for I theLordyour God am holy” (*Lv 19:2*,rsv). The holiness enjoined by the OT was twofold: (1) external, or ceremonial; and (2) internal, or moral and spiritual. OT ceremonial holiness, prescribed in the Pentateuch (the first five books of the OT) included ritual consecration to God’s service. Thus priests and Levites were sanctified by a complex process of ritual consecration (*Ex 29*), as were the Hebrew Nazirites, which means “separated ones” (*Nm 6:1-21*). Prophets like Elisha (*2 Kgs 4:9*) and Jeremiah (*Jer 1:5*) were also sanctified for a special prophetic ministry in Israel.\n\nBut the OT also draws attention to the inner, moral, and spiritual aspects of holiness. Men and women, created in the image of God, are called to cultivate the holiness of God’s own character in their lives (*Lv 19:2*;*Nm 15:40*). In the NT the ceremonial holiness prominent in the Pentateuch recedes to the background. Whereas much of Judaism in Jesus’ time sought a ceremonial holiness by works (*Mk 7:1-5*), the NT stresses the ethical rather than the formal dimension of holiness (vv*6-12*). With the coming of the Holy Spirit, the early church perceived that holiness of life was a profound internal reality that should govern an individual’s thought and attitudes in relation to persons and objects in the external world.\n\nThe NT Greek equivalent of the common Hebrew word for holiness signifies an inner state of freedom from moral fault and a relative harmony with the moral perfection of God. The word “godlikeness” or “godliness” captures the sense of the primary Greek word for holiness. Another Greek word approximates the dominant OT concept of holiness as external separation from the profane and dedication to the service of the Lord.\n\nBecause the NT writers assumed the OT portrait of deity, holiness is ascribed to God in relatively few apostolic texts. Jesus affirmed the ethical nature of God when he enjoined his disciples to pray that the Father’s name might be esteemed for what it is: “Hallowed be thy name” (*Mt 6:9*,kjv). In the book of Revelation the Father’s moral perfection is extolled with the threefold ascription of holiness borrowed from Isaiah: “Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come” (*Rv 4:8*,rsv; cf.*Is 6:3*). Luke, however, contemplated God’s holiness in terms of the dominant OT concept of his transcendence and majesty (*Lk 1:49*).\n\nSimilarly the holiness of Jesus Christ is asserted in the NT. Luke (*Lk 1:35*;*4:34*), Peter (*Acts 3:14*;*4:27-30*), the writer of Hebrews (*Heb 7:26*), and John (*Rv 3:7*) ascribe holiness to both the Father and the Son.\n\nSince the Spirit comes from God, discloses his holy character, and is the instrument of God’s holy purposes in the world, he also is absolutely holy (*Mt 1:18*;*3:16*;*28:19*;*Lk 1:15*;*4:14*). The common title “Holy Spirit” underscores the ethical perfection of the third person of the Godhead (*Jn 3:5-8*;*14:16-17, 26*).\n\nIn the NT, holiness also characterizes Christ’s church. The apostle Paul taught that Christ loved the church and died for it “that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word” (*Eph 5:26*,rsv). Peter addressed the church as a holy people in language borrowed from the OT. Separated from the unbelieving nations and consecrated to the Lord, the church is “a holy nation” (*1 Pt 2:9*; cf.*Ex 19:6*).\n\nBut the NT more often discusses holiness in relation to individual Christians. Believers in Christ are frequently designated as “saints,” literally meaning “holy ones,” since through faith God justifies sinners, pronouncing them “holy” in his sight. A justified sinner is by no means morally perfect, but God does declare believers to be guiltless. Thus, although Christians at Corinth, for example, were plagued with numerous sins, Paul could address his erring friends as those who were “sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints” (*1 Cor 1:2*,rsv). Despite their problems, the Corinthian believers were “holy ones” in Christ.\n\nThe NT, however, places great stress upon the reality of practical holiness in the Christian’s daily experience. The God who freely declares a person righteous through faith in Christ commands that the believer progress in holiness of life. In God’s plan, a growth in holiness should accompany believing. God graciously provides the spiritual resources to enable Christians to be “partakers of the divine nature” (*2 Pt 1:4*).\n\n*See also**God, Being and Attributes of*.\n\n
Hope	HOPE\n\nAn expectation or belief in the fulfillment of something desired. Present hurts and uncertainty over what the future holds create the constant need for hope. Worldwide poverty, hunger, disease, and human potential to generate terror and destruction create a longing for something better. Historically, people have looked to the future with a mixture of longing and fear. Many have concluded that there is no reasonable basis for hope and therefore that to hope is to live with an illusion. Scripture tells us that those who do not have God do not have hope (*Eph 2:12*).\n\nThe modern world has sought hope in human effort and a belief in the inevitability of progress that assumed everything would naturally get better and better. The threat and reality of war in the 20th century challenged that optimism and left growing despair in its wake. Though many still find little reason to hope, others have returned to a humanistic basis for hope. It is held that because people are the source of the world’s problems, they can also be the solution. This position can be called into question on the basis of present and historical evidence to the contrary.\n\nChristianity has often been considered in discussions concerning hope. Unfortunately, Christianity has not always received “good press” in this regard. In the early centuries of church history, stress on the disparity between this world and the next seemed to create an attitude of escapism, futility, or indifference toward the problems and pains of human existence. In the 19th century Prussian philosopher Frederick Nietzsche (1844–1900) claimed that Christianity made people cowards because it taught that whatever happened was God’s will, thus discouraging efforts to change the world. Karl Marx (1818–83) said that Christianity or religion was the “opiate of the people.” For Marx, religion kept people from rising against those who oppressed them.\n\nThe tendency for Christianity to be viewed as otherworldly was opposed by Jürgen Moltmann in what has been called “the theology of hope.” That theology was the product of the pessimism and despair of post-World War II Europe. Moltmann’s theology of hope says that the future is the basis for changing the present, and that Christian service should be an attempt to make otherworldly hopes a present reality. The resurrection is said to bring hope amid present suffering by becoming the catalyst for human effort to overcome that suffering. But trust in human effort to change the future could lead to a humanistic notion that the resurrection is merely a hopeful symbol that will spur people into action, and not necessarily a reality of God’s historical action in the world through Jesus Christ. Another concern is that the discussion of hope for this world by a transformation of political and social structures could neglect the need for personal transformation of people’s lives through conversion and repentance. While critical questions have been raised about the theology of hope, on the positive side that theology has led to examination or reexamination of the biblical doctrine of hope.\n\nBiblical hope is hope in what God will do in the future. At the heart of Christian hope is the resurrection of Jesus. Paul discussed the nature, certainty, and importance of the resurrection (*1 Cor 15:12-28*). That Paul is certain that Christian hope points to the future can be seen by his statement “If we have hope in Christ only for this life, we are the most miserable people in the world” (v*19*,nlt). The significance of Christ’s resurrection is that it not only points to his victory over death but also extends that victory to those who are his: “Christ was raised first; then when Christ comes back, all his people will be raised” (v*23*). The apostle Peter said, “All honor to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, for it is by his boundless mercy that God has given us the privilege of being born again. Now we live with a wonderful expectation because Jesus Christ rose again from the dead” (*1 Pt 1:3*,nlt). In that passage, Peter attributes living hope to the resurrection of Christ and points to God’s future blessing upon those who belong to Christ. That future hope empowers the Christian to live without despair through the struggle and suffering of the present (cf.*Rom 8:18*;*2 Cor 4:16-18*).\n\nChristian hope is securely based upon the words and actions of God. The promises of God have proven to be dependable. The resurrection of Jesus becomes the ultimate basis for hope. Since God has already overcome death through Christ, the Christian can live with confidence in the present. No matter how dark the present age seems, the Christian has seen the light to come. People need to hope, and hope placed in the personal promise of God is secure. This secure hope is full of social significance, however, freeing one from bondage to materialism and its natural selfishness. Christian hope offers security for the future and loving involvement in sharing for the present.\n\n
Lord	LORD\n\n“Lord” in English is the rendering of the Hebrew*‘adonai*or of the Greekkurios*.*The Hebrew YHWH is usually rendered “Lord”;*See**Yahweh (YHWH)*.\n\nGod’s rule and authority as Lord rests ultimately upon his creation and ownership of all things and people (*Ps 24:1-2*). God’s total supremacy over nature is emphasized by his being called the Lord over earthquakes, wind, fire (*1 Kgs 19:10-14*), stars (*Is 40:26*), beasts and sea monsters (*Jb 40–41*), and primeval chaos (*Pss 74:12-14*;*89:8-10*).\n\nThe later prophets indicated that God is Lord or King of history because he directs the affairs of humans and nations (*1 Kgs 19:15-18*;*Is 10:5-9*;*Am 9:7*) and he is the Lord of universal morality (*Ez 25–32*;*Am 1:3–2:16*). But he is especially the Lord of Israel; his expressed will represents their civil and religious constitution and demands absolute obedience (*Ex 20:2*). The divine sovereignty was, however, Israel’s comfort under oppression and hope for the future, when a triumphant Day of the Lord would right its wrongs, punish its oppressors, and restore its glory (*Is 2:2-4, 11-12*;*34:8*;*Ez 30:1-5*;*Jl 2:31–3:1*).\n\nIn the Septuagint, the regular expression for “Lord/ lord/master” iskurios*,*which in the Greek NT also is used of masters, husbands, and rulers (*Mt 25:11*;*Lk 14:21*;*Acts 25:26*;*1 Pt 3:6*); of God (*Mt 11:25*;*Heb 8:2*); and of pagan gods (*1 Cor 8:5*). It is used of Jesus as a customary title of respect (“sir,”*Mt 8:2*;*15:25*); it also retains its Septuagint associations of faith, reverence, and worship (*Mt 3:3*;*Lk 7:13*;*Acts 5:14*;*9:10*;*1 Cor 6:13-14*;*Heb 2:3*;*Jas 5:7*); it appears in phrases like “the Lord Jesus,” “the Lord’s Day,” “the Lord’s Table,” “the Spirit of the Lord” (who is also “Lord,”*2 Cor 3:17*), “in the Lord,” “from the Lord,” “light in the Lord,” “boast in the Lord.” Sometimes it is not clear whether God or Christ is intended (*Acts 9:31*;*2 Cor 8:21*). The title is attributed to Jesus himself in*John 13:13-14*; in*John 20:28*Jesus accepts the title “My Lord and my God!”\n\nIn the first Christian sermon Jesus’ lordship is made central to salvation (*Acts 2:21*). It appears that the public confession of Jesus as Lord was the approved focus and expression of Christian faith, and the basis of membership in the apostolic church (*Acts 16:31*;*Rom 10:9*;*1 Cor 12:3*;*Phil 2:11*). Thus, it could become more a formal statement than a sincere expression of belief—hence, the warnings in*Matthew 7:21*and*Luke 6:46*.\n\nFrom the first, such a confession was fraught with meaning. In common usage “lord” reflected the slave system and implied the absolute power exercised by the master over the purchased slave. So Paul unhesitatingly expounds the moral implications of Christian redemption (*1 Cor 6:19-20*;*7:22-23*;*see*photo). To Jewish minds, the title had messianic overtones of kingship and authority (*Lk 20:41-44*), offending both Jews and Romans. Politically, “Lord” was a title claimed by Caesar. Therefore, it is significant that Jesus is called “King of kings and Lord of lords” during the age of Domitian when Caesar worship was mandated (*Rv 17:14*;*19:16*).\n\nAmong Greek-speaking Jews of the dispersion, familiar with the Septuagint, as among Gentiles, for whom “Lord” was the customary title for the many gods of polytheism, the application to Jesus of the epithet belonging to godhead was blasphemous, especially when associated with “Son of God,” prayer, praise, total devotion, and hope (*1 Cor 8:5-6*;*Phil 2:9-11*;*1 Thes 4:14-17*). On every level, therefore, the adoring tribute given to Jesus was loaded not only with spiritual meaning but with positive and imminent danger.\n\n*See also**Christology*;*God, Being and Attributes of*;*God, Names of*.\n\n
PaultheApostle	PAUL, The Apostle\n\nProminent leader of the first-century church; apostle to the Gentiles; author of 13 NT epistles.\n\nPreview\n\n• *Family and Cultural Background*\n\n• *Education*\n\n• *Saul the Persecutor*\n\n• *Conversion and Calling*\n\n• *Preparation for Ministry*\n\n• *Sent Out from Antioch*\n\n• *Traveling with Barnabas*\n\n• *The Council of Jerusalem*\n\n• *Further Travel*\n\n• *Labor in the Gospel*\n\n• *The Arrest in Jerusalem*\n\n• *Voyage and Stay in Rome*\n\n• *Final Years and Martyrdom*\n\nFamily and Cultural Background\n\nPaul was born aroundAD10, a Jew in a family of Pharisees (*Acts 23:6*) of the tribe of Benjamin (*Phil 3:5*) in Tarsus of Cilicia (*Acts 9:11*;*21:39*;*22:3*), a center of commerce and learning that embraced the Hellenistic spirit and Roman politics. It was a city of which he could be proud (*21:39*). His parents named him Saul, perhaps after the first king of Israel, who was also a Benjaminite (*1 Sm 11:15*;*Acts 13:21*), but*Acts 13:9*notes that he “was also called Paul.” He uses the Roman name Paul throughout his letters.\n\nFrom religious parents Paul received knowledge of the Law and Prophets and the Hebrew and Aramaic languages (*Acts 21:40*;*22:2-3*;*23:6*;*Gal 1:14*;*Phil 3:5-6*). Tarsus, however, was not a Jewish city. Rather, it had a Greek character, being a place where the Greek language was spoken and Greek literature was cultivated. This accounts for Paul’s familiarity with Greek (*Acts 21:37*), the language of the streets and shops of Tarsus.\n\nJews were brought to Tarsus, the capital of the Roman province of Cilicia, in 171BCto promote business in the region. At that time Paul’s ancestors were probably given Roman citizenship. Paul inherited from his father both Tarsisian and Roman citizenship, which would prove to be of great value to Paul in his later life as he traveled with the gospel throughout the Roman Empire (*Acts 16:37*;*22:25-29*;*23:27*). Paul may have had several brothers and sisters, but*Acts 23:16*mentions only one sister, whose son performed a lifesaving act for his uncle.\n\nPaul was a tent maker (*Acts 18:3*). He may have learned this trade from his father, or he may have selected it as a means of self-support, as was the custom of those in rabbinical training. Tarsus was well known for the goat’s-hair cloth called cilicium. It was the weaving of this cloth and the fashioning of it into tents, sails, awnings, and cloaks that gave Paul his economic independence during his apostolic ministry (*Acts 18:3*;*20:34*;*28:30*;*2 Cor 11:9*;*1 Thes 2:9*;*2 Thes 3:8*).\n\nEducation\n\nAlthough born in Tarsus, Paul testified to the Jews in Jerusalem that he had been brought up in this city and studied under Gamaliel (*Acts 22:3*). It is not clear when Paul was first brought to Jerusalem, but it is likely that sometime between the ages of 13 and 20 he began his formal rabbinical studies. His teacher, Gamaliel, was the grandson of Hillel, founder of a Pharisaic school whose teachings run through the Talmudic writings to this day. This is the same Gamaliel whose wisdom persuaded the Sanhedrin to spare the lives of Peter and the apostles (*5:33-40*). No doubt, it was while studying under Gamaliel in Hillel’s school that Paul began to advance in Judaism beyond many Jews of his own age and became extremely zealous for the traditions of his fathers (*Gal 1:14*). Perhaps then also Paul began to experience the struggles with the law he would later describe in*Romans 7*.\n\nWhile Paul was studying the Jewish law in Jerusalem, Jesus was working as a carpenter in Nazareth. Then Jesus gathered the disciples who would one day be Paul’s coworkers in the gospel, fulfilled his ministry, and accomplished redemption on the cross of Calvary (AD30). Christ’s resurrection gave birth to the church, which was baptized in the Holy Spirit at the Feast of Pentecost in Jerusalem.\n\nSaul the Persecutor\n\nShortly after these world-changing events, the members of certain synagogues in Jerusalem, including the Cilician synagogue, that of Paul’s native land (*Acts 6:9*), could not withstand the wisdom and spirit (v*10*) of a member of the church in Jerusalem named Stephen (vv*5, 8*). They accused him of blasphemy before the Sanhedrin (vv*11-15*) and after his eloquent defense (*7:1-53*) dragged him out of the city, where he was stoned to death. He became the first Christian martyr. The record does not fully reveal the role Paul played in these proceedings, but we know that he was present and prominent because the witnesses against Stephen, who were required to throw the first stones in the execution, “laid their clothes at the feet of a young man called Saul [Paul]” (v*58*,niv).\n\nAt Stephen’s trial, Paul heard Stephen’s historical method of defense, and he later used it himself at Antioch of Pisidia (*Acts 13:16-41*). He witnessed the man with the face of an angel (*6:15*), full of the Holy Spirit, looking above and proclaiming “the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of God” (*7:56*). Stephen’s death initiated the events that would culminate in Paul’s conversion and commission as the apostle to the Gentiles. But at that time Paul was a leader of the oppressors of the church. He breathed threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord (*9:1*); he persecuted the church of God and tried to destroy it (*Gal 1:13*) by imprisoning Christians, both male and female (*Acts 22:4*), in many cities.\n\nConversion and Calling\n\nPaul had obtained letters from the high priest in Jerusalem to the synagogues in Damascus authorizing him to arrest the believers there and bring them to Jerusalem for trial (*Acts 9:1-2*). Paul traveled to Damascus for this purpose. Then, on the outskirts of the city, came the event that was to transform this law-keeping persecutor of Jesus Christ and blasphemous destroyer of the infant church into the chief propagator of the gospel of grace and master builder of the church (*1 Cor 3:10*;*1 Tm 1:13*). This was the occasion of Paul’s conversion (c.AD31–33). It was of such revolutionary and lasting importance that three detailed accounts of it are given in the book of Acts (*Acts 9:1-19*;*22:1-21*;*26:1-23*), and many references are given to it in Paul’s own writings (*1 Cor 9:1*;*15:8*;*Gal 1:15-16*;*Eph 3:3*;*Phil 3:12*).\n\nAt that time a light from heaven, brighter than the midday sun, shone around Paul and his traveling companions, and they fell to the ground (*Acts 26:13-14*). Only Paul, however, heard the voice of Jesus instruct him in his commission as a minister and witness to the Gentiles (vv*14-18*). Temporarily blinded, Paul was led into Damascus (*9:8*). There, the disciple Ananias and the Christian community forgave Paul, baptized him, and helped him through the bewildering event of his conversion (vv*10-22*). After a short time with the church there, Paul was threatened with death by the Jews to whom he preached Jesus (vv*20-22*), but he was protected by the believers and ingeniously delivered from his persecutors (vv*23-25*).\n\nPreparation for Ministry\n\nThen began a period of preparation, which lasted about 13 years. During this time, Paul first was in the desert of Arabia for three years. Here was his opportunity to pray and reflect on Stephen’s defense to the Sanhedrin, the momentous significance of his conversion, the vision he received of Jesus Christ, and the meaning of all this in the light of Jewish theology. Following this, Paul returned to Damascus and then visited Peter in Jerusalem for 15 days (*Gal 1:17-18*).\n\nAt first, the disciples in Jerusalem were afraid of him because they did not believe he was a disciple of Jesus (*Acts 9:26*), but he was championed by Barnabas and thus accepted by the believers in Jerusalem (vv*27-28*). While there, Paul may have heard the oral gospel, a summary of the words and deeds of Jesus, handed down to all converts. This would have included the institution of the Lord’s Supper (*1 Cor 11:23-25*), specific words of the Lord (*Acts 20:35*;*1 Cor 7:10*;*9:14*), the appearances of the resurrected Christ (*1 Cor 15:3-8*), and the spirit and character of Jesus (*2 Cor 10:1*;*Phil 2:5-8*). Paul also preached in Jerusalem, perhaps in the same synagogues in which he had heard Stephen. However, when his life was again threatened by the Jews, the believers sent him away to Tarsus (*Acts 9:29-30*;*Gal 1:21*).\n\nThe end of Paul’s preparation came when Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for him and bring him to Antioch. By this time Paul had lived for 10 years in Cilicia. Since his conversion, before being sent to Tarsus, he had proclaimed Jesus (*Acts 9:20*), speaking boldly in the name of the Lord (v*27*). There is no reason to think he did otherwise while living among the Gentiles in Cilicia. In fact, his work may have been so effective that he began to attract attention in Antioch. During these years, Paul probably underwent many of the sufferings mentioned in*2 Corinthians 11:24-26*. Several scholars think that the ecstatic experience mentioned in*2 Corinthians 12:1-9*, with its accompanying thorn in the flesh, also took place before he came to Antioch.\n\nSent Out from Antioch\n\nThe church in Antioch had its origins in the persecution fomented by Paul after the death of Stephen. Until they arrived in Antioch, the scattered believers had only spoken the word to Jews (*Acts 11:19*). It was here that the Gentiles first heard the Good News (v*20*), and many became believers (v*21*). It is fitting that Paul, the apostle to the Gentiles (*Acts 22:21*;*Rom 11:13*), who was as yet unknown by sight to the churches of Judea (*Gal 1:22*), should appear in Antioch to formally begin the ministry to which he was called (*Acts 26:17-18*).\n\nBarnabas and Paul stayed with the church in Antioch for a year. Their work there was so blessed that a new name, Christian, was coined to distinguish the believers in Antioch from Gentiles and Jews (*Acts 11:26*). Hearing of a famine in Judea, the disciples in Antioch determined to send relief to the believers in Judea and did so by Barnabas and Paul (v*30*). Such a gift displayed to the Jewish churches the potency of the gospel among the Gentiles. Their mission complete, Barnabas and Paul returned to Antioch with John Mark (*12:25*), Barnabas’s cousin (*Col 4:10*).\n\nBeginning from the Day of Pentecost, the work in the gospel had been casual and incidental. Contacts were made in the homes, the marketplace, the streets, synagogues, highways, etc. (*Acts 3:1*;*5:12, 42*;*8:26-29*;*10:22*). But in Antioch the Holy Spirit initiated a determined effort to evangelize a section of the Roman Empire (*13:1-3*). By the Holy Spirit’s instructions, the church separated Barnabas and Paul for this work. With the prayers and encouragement of this church, and with John Mark as their assistant, Barnabas and Paul, sent out by the Holy Spirit, sailed for Cyprus (v*4*).\n\nTraveling with Barnabas\n\nArriving in Salamis, they preached in the synagogues as they traveled the length of the island to Paphos (*Acts 13:5-6*). There the Roman proconsul, Sergius Paulus, wanted to hear the word of God (v*7*). A magician named Elymas Bar-Jesus tried to prevent the proconsul from believing in Jesus but was stricken with temporary blindness by Paul’s command (vv*8-11*). This was the first manifestation in Paul of the signs of an apostle (*2 Cor 12:12*). From then on, the name Paul, not Saul, is used in Luke’s record of the Acts of the Apostles (*Acts 13:9*), and Paul replaced Barnabas as the leader of the party. So “Paul and his company” set sail from Paphos and arrived in Perga of Pamphylia (v*13*). John Mark deserted them at Perga and returned to his home in Jerusalem (v*13*). This caused discord (*15:39*), but Paul and Mark were later reconciled (*Col 4:10*;*2 Tm 4:11*).\n\nPaul’s travels with the gospel now continued through the Roman province of Asia, specifically in the southern portion of Galatia, the areas of Pamphylia, Pisidia, and Lycaonia. The coastal area where the party landed is a hot, malarial region. It is thought that Paul contracted malaria there and so traveled inland through the mountains to the 4,000-foot- (1,219.2-meter-) high tablelands. Such a journey would have been full of dangerous rivers and bandits (*2 Cor 11:26*), but Paul was well cared for by the Galatian highlanders when he arrived (*Gal 4:13-15*) and was rewarded with a warm reception to his message (*Acts 13:48-49*).\n\nPaul and Barnabas were asked to speak at the synagogue of Antioch in Pisidia (*Acts 13:15*), and Paul delivered a discourse full of the characteristics of the gospel he would later record in his letters to the churches (vv*16-41*). He was invited to speak the next week (v*42*); nearly the whole city gathered together to hear the word of God (v*44*). This stirred up jealousy in the Jews who opposed Paul’s words (v*45*), causing the apostles’ dramatic turn to the Gentiles (vv*46-47*). Many Gentiles in Antioch believed and spread the word throughout the region, but Paul and Barnabas were forced out and went to Iconium in Lycaonia (vv*48-51*).\n\nThe success in Antioch was duplicated in Iconium as was the Jews’ opposition (*Acts 14:1*), and the apostles fled from the threat of a stoning to Lystra and Derbe in Lycaonia (vv*5-6*). In Lystra the signs of an apostle were again seen when Paul healed a man who had been crippled since birth (vv*8-10*). The idolatrous citizens of the town, however, primed by the popular belief that Jupiter, accompanied by Mercury, had once visited their region, worshiped Paul and Barnabas as these deities (vv*11-13*). Even the convincing words of Paul, whom they mistook for Mercury, hardly restrained the crowds from offering a sacrifice (vv*14-18*).\n\nIt was in Lystra that Paul was first given a taste of the same medicine he had once administered to Christians. The Jews stoned him, dragged him out of the city, and left him for dead (*Acts 14:19*). Timothy (*16:1-3*) may have been among the new disciples surrounding Paul as he lay outside the gate (*14:20*). Timothy was Paul’s son in the faith (*1 Cor 4:17*;*1 Tm 1:2*), eyewitness to his suffering (*2 Tm 3:10-11*), faithful companion, and fellow worker (*Acts 19:22*;*20:4*;*Rom 16:21*;*1 Thes 3:2*). The next day Barnabas and Paul went on to Derbe (*Acts 14:20*).\n\nAfter making many disciples in Derbe, the apostles retraced their steps through Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch of Pisidia, strengthening and encouraging the new believers and appointing elders in each church (*Acts 14:21-23*). Arriving again in Perga, they sailed back to Antioch of Syria, where they reported to the church the wonderful news that God had opened a door of faith for the Gentiles (vv*25-27*).\n\nThe Council of Jerusalem\n\nThe Jews, who had dogged the steps of Paul and Barnabas throughout Galatia, followed on their heels to bewitch the Gentiles there, convincing them to desert the grace of Christ and submit to the Jewish law (*Gal 1:6*;*3:1*). Shortly after the apostles’ return to Antioch, Judaizers came from Judea to Antioch, teaching salvation by the law (*Acts 15:1*). This began the war against the gospel of grace, which Paul preached.\n\nThe church in Antioch sent Paul, Barnabas, and others to Jerusalem to settle the controversy of the law versus grace with the apostles and elders there (AD49,*Acts 15:2*). Along the way to Jerusalem they spread the news of the conversion of the Gentiles. This brought great joy to the believers (v*3*). Such joy was not shared by some in Jerusalem, who in the first meeting of the council said that the Gentiles should be ordered to keep the law of Moses (v*5*).\n\nAfter this meeting, Paul and Barnabas met privately with Peter, John, and James (*Gal 2:1-10*) and explained the gospel they had been preaching to the Gentiles. These three leaders of the church in Jerusalem saw the grace that had been given to Paul to bring the gospel to the Gentiles and extended to him the “right hand of fellowship.” This private meeting seems to have decided the question of compliance to the Jewish law because in the next general meeting Peter said, “We believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus” (*Acts 15:11*,rsv), and James reached the decision that “we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God” (*Acts 15:19*,rsv). This was a great victory for Paul and Barnabas, and the news was received with rejoicing by the church in Antioch (vv*30-35*).\n\nLater, Peter visited Antioch and freely associated with the Gentile believers as he had timidly done in Cornelius’s house (*Acts 10:28*). This continued until “certain men came from James.” Their presence brought fear to Peter, clouding the light of the gospel of grace, and causing him to separate himself from the Gentiles. Peter’s action influenced others, including Barnabas, to do the same (*Gal 2:12-13*). Paul rose to the challenge of this serious crisis, confronted Peter publicly, and charged him with Judaizing and hypocrisy (v*14*). Paul won the battle and rescued Peter and Barnabas with eloquent words on justification by faith (vv*15-21*), but the Judaizers had resumed their war. From this time on, they did not rest; rather, they tormented and persecuted Paul all over the world. But the apostle did not submit to them for a moment. He was engaged in the fight of his life, so that the truth of the gospel might remain with the Gentile believers (v*5*).\n\nFurther Travel\n\nPaul wanted to visit the new believers and see how they were doing. So he proposed to Barnabas that they return to the cities where they had previously preached about Jesus (*Acts 15:36*). Barnabas wanted to take John Mark with them, but Paul would not take him since he had deserted them during their earlier journey (*13:13*). This sharp disagreement ended Barnabas’s association with Paul (*15:37-39*). Silas, a leader among the brothers in Jerusalem (v*22*), accompanied Paul as he set out by land through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches (vv*40-41*).\n\nBeginning from Derbe in Galatia, Paul and Silas revisited the churches Paul had established with Barnabas. While in Lystra, they were joined by Timothy (*Acts 16:1-3*). The apostles delivered to these young churches the letter drafted by the elders and apostles in Jerusalem concerning the observance of the law (*15:23-29*), thus strengthening and increasing them (*16:4-5*).\n\nIt is likely that Ephesus, a major city in the Roman province of Asia, was the party’s main objective for the advancement of the gospel, but they were “forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia” (*Acts 16:6*). Then they attempted to turn north and enter the region of Bithynia, “but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them” (v*7*). In this way they were forced by God to continue straight westward to Troas on the Aegean Sea, where Luke joined them (“we” in v*10*), and Paul had a vision in which he was called out of Asia into Macedonia (vv*8-9*). Paul and his party immediately crossed by boat into Europe (v*11*) where they carried the gospel to Philippi, Thessalonica, Berea, Athens, and Corinth.\n\nPhilippi was a Roman colony and military outpost where there were few Jews, so Paul went to a place by the river where the local Jews prayed. He spoke to some women there, notably Lydia, who believed and with her household was baptized (*Acts 16:12-15*), beginning the first church in Europe. Paul cast a spirit of divination out of a girl in Philippi, and as a result he and Silas were jailed (vv*16-24*). The events of their night in jail made the jailer a believer in God (vv*25-34*), and he and his family were added to the church in Philippi, which met in Lydia’s home (v*40*). When Paul disclosed his Roman citizenship, he was released and was asked to leave the city (vv*35-39*).\n\nAt Thessalonica the Jews, aroused to jealousy by the success of Paul’s gospel message, raised a mob to search for the apostles. They complained to the city authorities that the people “who have turned the world upside down have come here also” and accused the apostles of “saying that there is another king [besides Caesar], Jesus” (*Acts 17:5-7*).\n\nPaul and Silas quickly left Thessalonica by night and arrived in Berea, a city thereafter distinguished by its citizens who eagerly and thoughtfully received the gospel (*Acts 17:10-12*). The Thessalonian Jews did not rest but trailed Paul to Berea to incite the crowds. The believers then sent Paul away to Athens, while Silas and Timothy stayed behind (vv*13-15*).\n\nThe Athenians called Paul a babbler but let him air his views before the Areopagus. Paul’s speech there was alive with his broad knowledge. He alluded to Greco-Roman philosophy (*Acts 17:27*), poetry (v*28*), sculpture (vv*25, 29*), architecture (v*24*), and religion while proclaiming the existence of an “unknown god” (v*23*). But he was rudely cut short by scoffing and indifference when he mentioned the resurrection (v*32*). Paul’s words delighted the minds of many but influenced the wills of few, so when he arrived in Corinth, he determined not to proclaim the mystery of God in lofty words of wisdom so that the believers’ faith would not rest on human wisdom but on the power of God (*1 Cor 2:1-5*).\n\nIn Corinth Paul met Aquila and Priscilla (*Acts 18:2-3*), Roman Jews with whom he lived and worked as a tent maker and who would become prominent among the churches (*Acts 18:26*;*Rom 16:3*;*1 Cor 16:19*;*2 Tm 4:19*). He stayed in Corinth 18 months fromAD50 to 51, raising up a church (*Acts 18:11*) on the strength of a vision from God (vv*9-10*) and in spite of the attacks of the Jews (vv*12-17*). Paul wrote the first and second letters to the Thessalonians from Corinth to establish the believers in a holy, industrious life (*1 Thes 3:13*;*5:23*;*2 Thes 3:7-12*) in hope of the second coming of Jesus Christ (*1 Thes 4:15-18*;*2 Thes 2:1ff*.).\n\nAccompanied by Priscilla and Aquila, Paul sailed from Corinth for Syria. He left his fellow workers in Ephesus, sailed to Caesarea, briefly visited Jerusalem, and returned to Antioch (*Acts 18:18-22*). Paul stayed in Antioch for awhile but did not remain absent from the field of his labors for long. Alone, he departed from Antioch, went from place to place in Galatia and Phrygia strengthening all the disciples, and eventually arrived in Ephesus (*18:23*;*19:1*).\n\nLabor in the Gospel\n\nA Jew named Apollos had ministered in Ephesus prior to Paul’s arrival and had recently gone over to Corinth (*Acts 18:24-28*). There Apollos innocently became the cause of such discord (*1 Cor 3:3-9*) that he left and refused to return even at Paul’s request (*16:12*). Paul’s earlier visit to Ephesus (*Acts 18:19-20*), Apollos’s ministry, and the presence of Priscilla and Aquila had prepared Ephesus for the apostle’s preaching of the gospel of Christ.\n\nPaul began his work in Ephesus by setting straight some ill-informed disciples of John the Baptist (*Acts 19:1-7*). He then spent three months preaching at the local synagogue until members of the congregation “spoke evil of the Way” (v*9*). Paul then took the disciples and continued his arguments on the neutral ground of Tyrannus’s school (vv*8-9*), where Jews and Greeks were free to come. He continued there for two years and “all the residents of Asia, both Jews and Greeks, heard the word of the Lord” (v*10*).\n\nThe work in Ephesus was a great success (*Acts 19:10, 20, 26*). Paul enjoyed an open door for effective work (*1 Cor 16:9*), bolstered by extraordinary miracles (*Acts 19:11-17*), a public burning of valuable books of sorcery (vv*18-19*), and the assistance of friendly officials from the province of Asia (v*31*). There were also many adversaries (*1 Cor 15:32*;*16:9*), especially among the artisans associated with the temple of Diana. Paul’s ministry had hurt their trade to the extent that they were incited to riot (*Acts 19:23-41*). Paul had intended to stay in Ephesus until Pentecost (*1 Cor 16:8*), but this tumult seems to have hastened his departure (*Acts 20:1*).\n\nDuring his stay in Ephesus, the household of Chloe sent word to Paul from Corinth that there were divisions in the church there (*1 Cor 1:10-13*). This report generated a flurry of letters and travels. Paul wrote a letter, which is now lost, to this church (*5:9*). The church in Corinth wrote a letter (*7:1*) and sent messengers to Paul (*16:17*), and Paul sent Timothy to them (*4:17*;*16:10*). Paul then wrote 1 Corinthians (AD53) and sent it by Titus, who was to meet him in Troas to report the results (*2 Cor 2:12-13*).\n\nAfter his hasty exit from Ephesus, Paul found an open door for the gospel in Troas, but he so longed to hear from Corinth that he pushed on into Macedonia (*2 Cor 2:12-13*). There he was finally comforted by Titus (*7:5-7*) and rejoiced at the news of the Corinthians’ repentance, earnestness, longing, and zeal (vv*8-16*). From Macedonia Paul wrote 2 Corinthians (AD54), toured northwest to proclaim the good news of Christ in Illyricum (*Rom 15:19*), and then turned south for Achaia and his third visit to Corinth (*Acts 19:21*;*20:1-3*;*2 Cor 13:1*).\n\nThe time and place from which Paul wrote his letter to the Galatians is a topic of controversy. Some date it before the council at Jerusalem, aboutAD45. Others say he wrote it from Corinth at this stage in his history. The latter opinion is the choice of this narrative.\n\nA three-month winter stay in Corinth (AD55–56) produced the Letter to the Romans, which firmly set the benchmark of the gospel for all the ages. Paul had many personal friends in Rome (*Rom 16*) and had long intended to visit there (*1:10-15*). His plans were to deliver a collection from the Gentile churches to Jerusalem (*Acts 20:35*;*Rom 15:25-26*;*1 Cor 16:1*) and then visit Rome (*Acts 19:21*) on his way to Spain (*Rom 15:23-24*).\n\nThe Arrest in Jerusalem\n\nPaul’s trip from Corinth to Jerusalem was marked by abundant warnings of the danger awaiting him in Jerusalem. The Judaizers’ acrimony toward Paul was common talk everywhere, but all alarms went unheeded (*Acts 20:22-24, 38*;*21:4, 10-15*). However, the request for prayer in*Romans 15:30-32*shows that Paul knew he might soon need a divine rescue from the unbelievers in Judea.\n\nThe travelers, carrying the collection for Jerusalem, journeyed swiftly in order to reach Jerusalem by Pentecost (*Acts 20:16*). They proceeded by land from Achaia, through Macedonia, to Philippi in time for the Passover (springAD56, v*6*). Crossing by sea to Troas, they visited the believers there (vv*7-12*) and then sailed through the archipelago of the eastern Aegean Sea to Miletus (vv*13-16*). From Miletus, Paul sent for the elders of Ephesus, to whom he delivered an impassioned speech containing his own dire warnings for them (vv*17-38*).\n\nParting from them, Paul and his companions set sail to Cos, to Rhodes, and then to Patara, where they changed ships for Phoenicia (*Acts 21:1-2*). A straight course to Tyre brought them within sight of Cyprus, with its memories of Barnabas and Sergius Paulus (v*3*). “Through the Spirit” the disciples in Tyre “told Paul not to go on to Jerusalem” (v*4*), but he pressed on to Caesarea, where he and his company stayed with Philip, who had formerly served with the martyred Stephen (*21:8*; cf.*6:5*). In Caesarea, Paul would not be persuaded by an especially dramatic prophecy of his coming arrest (*21:10-14*).\n\nIn Jerusalem the apostolic band stayed with Mnason, an early disciple, and were warmly welcomed by the brothers there (*Acts 21:15-17*). James and the elders of the church praised God when they heard of the things he had done through Paul among the Gentiles (vv*18-20*), and when they received the collection from the churches (*24:17*). They told Paul of his bad reputation among the thousands of Jewish believers in Jerusalem and urged him to set right the Judaizers’ misrepresentation that he encouraged Jewish Christians to forsake the Mosaic customs (*21:21-24*).*Acts 21:25*shows the Jerusalem elders understood that the Gentiles were under no obligation to Moses; their concern was for Paul to demonstrate that Jewish believers were free to continue their traditional observances.\n\nPaul had kept the Jewish feasts (*Acts 20:6*), as had Jesus and the early disciples in Jerusalem. He had also cut his hair in a vow at Cenchreae (*18:18*), so it was a small matter for him, a Jew, to ceremonially purify himself after becoming a Christian, especially if it would undermine the arguments of the Judaizers. To have refused the elders’ request would have lent credence to the Judaizers’ charge. The success of this plan is seen in that it was the Jews from Asia, visiting Jerusalem for the Pentecost feast ofAD57, who stirred up trouble for Paul (*21:27-29*)—not the Judaizers from Jerusalem.\n\nThe whole city was aroused by Paul’s persistent persecutors. A violent crowd dragged him out of the temple just as Stephen had once been hauled to his martyrdom. They tried to kill him, but he was rescued by Roman soldiers as the mob cried, “Away with him!”—just as they had done to Jesus (*Acts 21:30-36*). At this juncture the educational and cultural diversity of Paul’s life came to his rescue. As he was carried for safety to the Roman barracks, he spoke in Greek to the tribune, who had mistaken him for an Egyptian assassin (vv*37-38*). Given permission to speak to the crowd, he did so in the Aramaic language then common in Israel (vv*39-40*). The hushed crowd eagerly heard Paul’s defense until he uttered the word “Gentiles.” At this, the crowd resumed its threatening and violence, and Paul was brought into the barracks (*22:1-24*). There the Romans prepared to flog him, until Paul revealed that he was not only a Jew from Tarsus but also a freeborn Roman citizen. The tribune was afraid, since he had bound a Roman citizen. Wanting to know the charges against Paul, he brought him to the Sanhedrin (vv*25-30*).\n\nThis meeting of the Jewish judiciary was shortly reduced to dissension and violence. Paul resorted to tactics justifiable in such a war and hopelessly divided the Sanhedrin on the subject of the resurrection (*Acts 23:1-9*). Paul again was rescued, this time from the contending factions of the Jewish leadership, and taken to the barracks, where the Lord encouraged him, promising that he would go to Rome (AD56, vv*10-11*).\n\nIn the meantime 40 Jews entered into a murderous plot against Paul. They vowed not to eat or drink until they had killed the apostle (*Acts 23:12-15*). They almost succeeded, but with the help of the son of Paul’s sister (v*16*), the conspiracy was exposed. For safety, Paul was taken from Jerusalem to Caesarea under guard of 470 soldiers and handed over to the custody of Felix the governor (vv*16-35*). Inconclusive hearings before Felix (*Acts 24*), his successor, Festus (*25:1-12*), and King Agrippa (*25:23–26:32*) occupied Paul in his two years of imprisonment in Caesarea. Festus, wanting to please the Jews, suggested that Paul be returned to Jerusalem for trial, but Paul knew the murderous intent of his accusers and again utilized his Roman citizenship by making a dramatic appeal to Caesar (*25:9-12*).\n\nVoyage and Stay in Rome\n\nTo plead his case at Caesar’s court, Paul and his companions, Aristarchus and Luke, were taken on a perilous voyage (AD58,*Acts 27:1–28:16*). Their passage by ship from Caesarea to Rome is one of the most remarkable on record. Luke’s detailed account is a treasure of information on ancient ships, navigation, and seamanship. It is also a beautiful portrait of a heroic and dignified apostle Paul, the gospel’s ambassador in chains (*Eph 6:20*), who with the guidance and assurance of his God (*Acts 27:23-26*), led the 276 people on board to safety (v*37*).\n\nLuke traces the voyage stage by stage through every crisis, with a change of ship at Myra, delay at Fair Havens on Crete, and the shipwreck on Malta. Finally, in the spring ofAD59, they arrived at Puteoli, Italy, and made their way to Rome, welcomed by the believers along the Appian Way (*Acts 28:13-16*).\n\nLuke provided a peaceful denouement to the Acts, notwithstanding the fact that the apostle was an imperial prisoner of Caesar Nero. Paul lived by himself in his own house, chained to a Roman guard (*Acts 28:16, 30*). There he received the local Jewish leaders—to calm any misgivings they may have had about him and, at the same time, to convince them about Jesus. His efforts had mixed success (vv*17-28*). During Paul’s two or more years in Rome, the Judaizers seem to have withdrawn, only to be replaced by the peril of Eastern Gnosticism. This is seen in Paul’s letters to the Philippians, Colossians, and Ephesians, and to Philemon, all written at this time. It is unlikely that Paul’s accusers appeared in Rome to bring formal charges before Caesar, so Paul was probably released inAD61.\n\nFinal Years and Martyrdom\n\nIt is here assumed that the Pastoral Letters (1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, and Titus) are truly Paul’s work. Only through them can the probable course of events in Paul’s final years be traced.*Romans 15:28*shows that Paul intended to deliver the collection to Jerusalem and then to “set out by way of you [Rome] to Spain.” The arrest and imprisonment in Jerusalem not only destroyed these plans but also extracted five precious years from the prime of a most productive life. Although Clement of Rome implied that Paul did fulfill his desire to go to Spain (*Clement to the Corinthians*5), it is certain that the daily pressure of Paul’s anxious care for all the churches (*2 Cor 11:28*) did not abate.\n\nIf Paul went to Spain, he may have been there when Rome was burned on July 19,AD64. Tradition says that Paul traveled as far as Britain, but there is no evidence to confirm this. Returning east, he left Titus in Crete (*Ti 1:5*) and traveled through Miletus, south of Ephesus, where he left Trophimus sick (*2 Tm 4:20*). Traveling toward Macedonia, Paul visited Timothy in Ephesus (*1 Tm 1:3*). On the way, Paul left his cloak and books with Carpus in Troas (*2 Tm 4:13*). This indicates that he intended to return there for his possessions. From Macedonia Paul wrote his loving yet apprehensive first letter to Timothy (AD62–64). He had decided to spend the winter in Nicopolis (*Ti 3:12*), northwest of Corinth on the Adriatic Sea, but was still in Macedonia when he wrote his letter to Titus. This letter is similar to 1 Timothy, yet with a somewhat harsher tone. In it is a final glimpse of the eloquent and zealous Apollos (*Ti 3:13*), who is still in association with Paul 10 or more years after his first appearance in Ephesus (*Acts 18:24*).\n\nFrom here Paul’s path is obscure. He may have wintered in Nicopolis, but he did not return to Troas for his winter cloak (*2 Tm 4:13*). At some point he was arrested by the Romans, because he spent a winter in Rome’s Mamertine Prison, suffering from the cold in that rock cell before he wrote his second letter to Timothy (AD66–67). He may have been anticipating the coming winter when he requested that Timothy bring his cloak (vv*13, 21*). It is possible that the charges against Paul were related to the burning of Rome; this is unknown. It was, however, now “illegal” to be a Christian since the “new religion” was no longer protected by Roman law as being part of Judaism (which was a legalized, recognized religion by Roman law).\n\nIt was dangerous to be associated with Paul at this time. Many deserted him (*2 Tm 4:16*), including all his coworkers in Asia (*1:15*) and Demas, who loved the world (*4:10*). Only Luke, the physician and author of Luke and Acts, was with him when he wrote his second letter to Timothy (v*11*). Faithful believers still in hiding in Rome were also in contact with the apostle (*1:16*;*4:19, 21*). He told Timothy to come to him in Rome and bring Mark also (*4:11*). Apparently Timothy did come and was imprisoned (*Heb 13:23*). Paul’s request for the books and parchments (*2 Tm 4:13*) discloses that he was reading and studying the Scripture to the end.\n\nThe apostle Paul had two hearings before Caesar Nero. At his first defense only the Lord stood by him (*2 Tm 4:16*). There he not only pleaded his own cause but also that of the gospel, still longing that all the Gentiles would hear its message. Perhaps no decision was made, and thus he was “rescued from the lion’s mouth” (v*17*). Though he knew he would soon die, he was not afraid, but was assured that the Lord would give him a crown of righteousness on the last day (v*8*). Finally, the apostle himself recorded his seminal encouragement to all believers: “The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you” (v*22*,rsv). After this, the Scripture is silent regarding Paul.\n\nNothing is known of Paul’s second hearing but that it resulted in the sentence of capital punishment. History does not record Paul’s end. Nero died in the summer ofAD68, so Paul was executed before that date. As a Roman citizen, he must have been spared the lingering torture that had recently been suffered by his fellow martyrs. Tradition says that he was decapitated by the sword of an imperial headsman on the Ostian Road just outside of Rome, and buried nearby. This fulfilled Paul’s desire “to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better” (*Phil 1:23*,rsv).\n\n
Philippi	PHILIPPI\n\nMinor village of Thrace (known in antiquity as “The Springs”) until about 357BC, when the father of Alexander the Great, Philip II of Macedon, conquered the site and rebuilt it. He gave the village his name (“Philip’s City”), fortified it as a military stronghold in subduing the area, and exploited the nearby gold mines. Two hundred years later, in the Roman era, it became a chief city of one of the four Roman districts into which Macedonia was divided. But because it was about 10 miles (16.1 kilometers) inland from the port of Neapolis, its growth was limited. Nearby Amphipolis (southwest) was the center of Roman government.\n\nPhilippi gained worldwide fame in 42BC, as the site where the imperial armies of Antony and Octavian defeated the republican generals Brutus and Cassius (the assassins of Julius Caesar). The victory opened the way for the emergence of the Roman Empire under the rule of Octavian (Augustus).\n\nVeterans from the war of 42BCand other battles commonly settled in Philippi. When Paul came to the city, it still reflected its Latin military heritage. Situated on the Ignatian Way, it was one stop on that great military highway connecting the Adriatic with the Aegean. It possessed distinct civic pride inasmuch as it was a Roman colony (enjoying numerous privileges, such as tax exemptions), promoted Latin as its official language, and hosted numerous Roman citizens. Its government was modeled on the municipal constitution of Rome (its leader bearing Roman titles throughout), and the people lived as if they were indeed located in Italy. As Luke records in*Acts 16:21*, the citizens viewed themselves as Romans.\n\nPaul visited the city on his second missionary tour and years later wrote one letter to the church. The account of Acts gives detailed attention to Paul’s visit. The narrative frequently refers to the city’s Roman heritage: not only does Paul successfully employ his Roman citizenship in his defense (*Acts 16:37*), but the city magistrates bear the dignified Latin title*praetor*(given in its Greek translation,strategos—vv*20-22, 38*—and which English Bibles translate “magistrate”). There appears to have been a small Jewish community here. The church began with believing Jewish women who met outside the city because there was no synagogue. Later, they convened in the home of an important woman convert named Lydia (vv*14-15, 40*).\n\nSome have suggested that Luke may have had a special interest in Philippi. This is surmised not only by his careful attention to the city but also by the “we” sections of the book of Acts. The first “we” section (when Luke joins Paul) begins and ends at Philippi (*Acts 16:10, 40*). This suggests that Luke stayed behind in the city after Paul’s departure. Then on the third tour Luke joins Paul again when the apostle passes through Philippi (*20:6*).\n\n
Savior	SAVIOR\n\nOne who delivers or rescues. The term “savior” is most frequently applied to God and Jesus Christ in the Bible. The understanding of Jesus as Savior is a key truth in appropriating the biblical message. Versions of the English Bible use “savior” in the OT to translate various forms of the Hebrew*yasha‘**,*which means “to save,” “to deliver,” or “to rescue.” Most frequently it is used to translate the participle of the verb,*moshia‘**,*meaning “the one who saves.” Used in this way, “savior” is found 13 or 14 times in the OT, depending upon the version.\n\nThe basic understanding of the term “savior” as one who delivers or rescues is illustrated in*Deuteronomy 22:27*, where the law anticipated a situation when no deliverer was near in time of need.*Moshia‘*is also used for individuals, as both Othniel and Ehud are called “deliverers” (*Jgs 3:9, 15*) and*Nehemiah 9:27*speaks of the judges collectively as deliverers sent by God.*Second Kings 13:5*reports that the Lord gave Israel a savior in reference to their deliverance from the Arameans. Some have identified this deliverer with King Jeroboam II of Judah; others with a foreign king, quite often Zakir of Hamath. But the text does not clearly indicate who this savior might have been. The point of the text is that God sent this deliverer for his people. The majority of references in the OT refer to God himself as Israel’s savior, and even when other individuals are so termed, it is clearly stated that God sent them or raised them up. Israel understood that God was their savior and declared this in songs of praise (*Pss 17:7*;*106:1-12*) and cries for help (*Jer 14:8*). David said this of God: “He is my stronghold, my refuge and my savior” (*2 Sm 22:3*,niv). Quite often the psalmists refer to the Lord as their “help” or “salvation” (*Pss 27:9*;*38:22*;*42:5, 11*;*65:5*;*68:19*;*79:9*;*85:4*;*89:26*; all rendered “Savior” by theniv). The exodus was undoubtedly the greatest example of deliverance for Israel and undergirded their knowledge of God as the savior. The psalmist, in remembrance of Israel’s sin of making a golden calf, proclaims, “They forgot God, their savior, who had done such great things in Egypt” (*Ps 106:21*,nlt; cf.*Is 63:11*;*Hos 13:4-6*). In Isaiah, where “savior” is a frequent title for God, the term is used to emphasize his uniqueness. God alone is seen as savior, in contrast to foreign gods and idols: “I, even I, am theLord, and apart from me there is no savior. I have revealed and saved and proclaimed—I, and not some foreign god among you” (*Is 43:11-12*,niv). Isaiah further states that God would show himself as savior by the future blessing and restoration of Israel (*49:26*;*60:16*). The designation “savior” is not directly applied to the Messiah in the OT, but a passage like*Zechariah 9:9*indicates that God’s Anointed One would be a deliverer. Several apocryphal books use the term “savior” for God, some in lofty titles like “everlasting Savior” (*Bar 4:22*) or “the eternal Savior of Israel” (*3 Macc 7:16*). This later usage also illustrates the idea of God as the one who is able to save Israel.\n\nThe Greek literature usessoter(“savior,” “deliverer” from the verbsozo“to save,” “to rescue”) for both gods and humans. For example, at one point Herodotus refers to the Athenians as the “saviors” of Greece (*Persian Wars*7.139.5). In the Septuagintsoter(“savior”) is used to render various forms of the Hebrew*yasha‘*(“to save”).Soteroccurs 24 times in the NT and is exclusively applied to God and Jesus Christ (to God 8 times and to Christ 16 times). Out of the 24 NT occurrences ofsoter*,*ten are in the Letters and five in 2 Peter. Dependence upon the OT can be seen in*Luke 1:47*, where Mary praises God as Savior in her hymn of praise. Jesus’ name (Greek for Joshua) means “the Lord is salvation” and was given in anticipation of his function as the Savior (*Mt 1:21*). As the Savior, Jesus completes God’s plan for a promised deliverer (*Acts 13:23*;*Ti 3:4*), provides redemption for humanity (*Ti 2:13-14*), and is the hope of the believer (*Phil 3:20-21*). Inherent in the term “savior” is the concept of one who saves or delivers from danger to a position of safety. Jesus has delivered the believer from sin and death into immortality and life (*2 Tm 1:10*). While Jesus never refers to himself as Savior (soter), he is announced as such by the angels at his birth (*Lk 2:11*), confessed as such by those who heard his words (*Jn 4:42*), and proclaimed as Savior by the early church (*Acts 5:31*;*13:23*). Salvation is central to the mission of Jesus (*Lk 19:10*). Paul teaches that Christ is the Savior of the church in the present (*Eph 5:23*) and future (*Phil 3:20*).\n\nSavior, as a title, is applied to God in the Pastoral Epistles and clearly represents God as Savior of all persons (*1 Tm 2:3*;*4:10*). The Pastorals also clearly designate Jesus as Savior (*2 Tm 1:10*;*Ti 3:6*), in some instances also declaring that he is God the Savior (*Ti 2:13*;*3:4-6*). Savior is used as a title for Jesus Christ throughout 2 Peter (e.g.,*2 Pt 2:20*). John, in his first letter, uses it to describe Jesus as the Savior sent by the Father to save the world (*1 Jn 4:14*).\n\n*See also**Salvation*.\n\n
Servant	SERVANT\n\nA person under obligation to serve a master, who in turn would provide a measure of protection. Some servants were slaves under legal bondage; others were servants voluntarily. It is not always possible to distinguish among “servant,” “slave,” “bondman,” and “bondwoman.” Several words in both Hebrew and Greek have been translated “servant,” although newer translations sometimes prefer other words.\n\nThe Hebrew word for “lad,” “youth,” or “boy” often means servant (*Ex 33:11*;*Nm 22:22*;*2 Kgs 4:12*). A word meaning “free-born servant” referred to the servants of the Lord, like the Levites (*Ezr 8:17*;*Is 61:6*;*Ez 44:11*) or priests (*Ex 28:35*;*Jl 1:9*;*2:17*). Sometimes ministers of the king are called servants (*1 Chr 27:1*;*Prv 29:12*), as are angels who minister before the Lord (*Pss 103:21*;*104:4*). The hired servant or hireling was also considered a free person (*Ex 12:45*;*Jb 7:1*;*Mal 3:5*).\n\nThe most common Hebrew term, occurring nearly 800 times in the OT, denotes a slave held in bondage (*Gn 9:25*;*12:16*;*Ex 20:17*;*Dt 5:15*;*15:17*). Yet the same word is used for people of noble rank, such as ministers and advisers to the king (*2 Kgs 22:12*;*2 Chr 34:20*;*Neh 2:10*) or a servant of God (*Gn 24:14*;*Nm 12:7*;*Jos 1:7*;*2 Kgs 21:8*), in such expressions as “Moses [or also David, Isaiah, Israel, Job, etc.] my servant.” One of the noblest expressions is “the servant of Yahweh [theLord]” (*Dt 34:5*;*Jos 1:13*;*8:31-33*;*Is 49:1-6*;*50:4-9*;*52:13–53:12*). The proper name Obadiah means “servant of Yahweh.”\n\nThe NT variously defines servant as a hired servant or hireling (*Mk 1:20*;*Lk 15:17-19*;*Jn 10:12-14*), more widely as a slave (*Mt 8:9*;*10:24-25*;*13:27-28*;*Mk 10:44*;*12:2-4*;*Lk 7:2-3, 8-10*;*Jn 4:51*;*8:34*;*13:16*;*Eph 6:5*;*Col 1:7*), and also as a domestic servant (*Lk 16:13*).\n\n*See also**Slave, Slavery*.\n\n
TimothyPerson	TIMOTHY (Person)\n\nPaul’s convert and companion, whose name means “one who honors God.”\n\nTimothy first appears in*Acts 16:1-3*as Paul’s disciple whose mother “was a believer; but his father was a Greek” (v*1*). He was a third-generation Christian after his mother, Eunice, and grandmother, Lois (*2 Tm 1:5*). The apostle Paul, undoubtedly Timothy’s spiritual father, refers to him as “my true child in the faith” (*1 Tm 1:2*); he perhaps converted Timothy on his first or second missionary journey. The son of a Greek (or Gentile) father, Timothy was yet uncircumcised; however, when Paul decided to take Timothy with him on the second journey, he had him circumcised so as not to hinder their missionary endeavors among the Jews.\n\nTimothy, who was well spoken of by the believers at Lystra and Iconium (*Acts 16:2*), became Paul’s companion and assistant on his second missionary journey at Lystra. He traveled with Paul into Europe following the Macedonian vision. When Paul decided to go to Athens, he left Silas and Timothy at Berea to establish the church there (*17:14*). Timothy and Silas eventually joined Paul in Corinth (*18:5*). He next appears with Paul in Ephesus on his third journey (*19:22*), from where Paul sends him into Macedonia ahead of himself. In the last mention of Timothy in*Acts 20:4*, he was included in the list of goodwill ambassadors who were to accompany Paul to Jerusalem with the offering for the Christian Jews.\n\nTimothy is often mentioned in the Pauline letters. His name is included in the introductory salutations of 2 Corinthians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, and Philemon. Timothy’s presence with Paul when he wrote these letters confirms the accuracy of the references to him in Acts. He was in Corinth on the second journey when Paul wrote 1 and 2 Thessalonians, at Ephesus on the third journey when Paul wrote 2 Corinthians, and in Rome during Paul’s first Roman imprisonment, when he wrote Philippians, Colossians, and Philemon. He is mentioned in the introductions of 1 and 2 Timothy as the recipient of those two letters.\n\nIn the closing salutations of*Romans 16:21*, Timothy is listed along with others who send their good wishes to the believers in Rome. In*1 Corinthians 4:17*and*16:10*, Paul speaks words of praise for Timothy as he sends him with a message to Corinth (see also*Phil 2:19-23*;*1 Thes 3:2-6*). In*2 Corinthians 1:19*Timothy is named, along with Paul and Silas, as men who were proclaiming the good news about Jesus Christ. Paul put Timothy in charge of the church at Ephesus and wrote him two pastoral letters to help him perform that responsible task.\n\nIn*Hebrews 13:23*the author (probably not Paul) tells his readers that Timothy had been released from prison, and that he hoped to come with Timothy to visit the readers of that letter. By this note, we know that Timothy experienced imprisonment.\n\n*See also**Timothy, First Letter to*;*Timothy, Second Letter to*.\n\n
TitusPerson	TITUS (Person)\n\n1. One of Paul’s converts—“my true child in a common faith” (*Ti 1:4*,nasb)—who became an intimate and trusted associate of the apostle in his mission of planting Christianity throughout the Mediterranean world (*2 Cor 8:23*;*2 Tm 4:10*;*Ti 1:4-5*). Mentioned frequently in Paul’s letters (eight times in 2 Corinthians, twice in Galatians, once each in 2 Timothy and Titus), his name occurs nowhere in Acts. This is a puzzling silence that some scholars have sought to explain with the fascinating, but uncertain, suggestion that he was a brother of Luke, the author of Acts.\n\nUnlike Timothy, who was half Jewish, Titus was born of gentile parents. Nothing is recorded of the circumstances surrounding his conversion and initial encounter with Paul. He is first introduced as a companion of Paul and Barnabas on a visit to Jerusalem (*Gal 2:3*). The occasion appears to have been the Jerusalem Council, aboutAD50, which Paul and Barnabas attended as official delegates from the church at Antioch not long after the apostle’s first missionary journey (*Acts 15*).\n\nWith the hotly contested issue of compulsory circumcision of gentile converts to Christianity before the council, Paul decided to make a test case of Titus. The council decided in Paul’s favor against the Judaizing party, and Titus was accepted by the other apostles and leaders of the Jerusalem church without submitting to the rite of circumcision. Thus, Titus became a key figure in the liberation of the infant church from the Judaizing party.\n\nTitus probably accompanied Paul from that time on, but he does not appear again until Paul’s crisis with the church at Corinth during his third missionary journey. According to 2 Corinthians, while Paul was conducting an extended ministry in Ephesus, he received word that the Corinthian church had turned hostile toward him and renounced his apostolic authority. Other attempts at reconciliation having failed, he sent Titus to Corinth to try to repair the breach. When Titus rejoined Paul somewhere in Macedonia, where the apostle had traveled from Ephesus to meet him, Titus brought the good news that the attitude of the Corinthians had changed and their former love and friendship were now restored (*2 Cor 7:6-7*). In view of this development Paul sent Titus back to Corinth, carrying 2 Corinthians, which included instructions to complete the collection of the relief offering for the Jewish Christians of Judea (*8:6, 16*). In this venture also Titus was apparently successful (*Rom 15:25-26*).\n\nAssuming that Paul was released after his first Roman imprisonment, it appears that Titus accompanied him on a mission to the island of Crete. On departing from Crete, Paul left Titus behind to consolidate the new Christian movement there (*Ti 1:5*). The assignment was difficult, for the Cretans were unruly and the struggling church was already invaded by false teachers (vv*10-16*). His handling of the Corinthian problem some years before, however, demonstrated that Titus possessed the spiritual earnestness, skillful diplomacy, and loving concern required to meet the present challenge, and Paul was confident that this new commission was therefore safe in his hands.\n\nPaul’s letter to Titus, one of his three Pastoral Letters, was written somewhat later to encourage Titus in his Cretan ministry. The letter closes with the apostle’s request that Titus join him at Nicopolis, a town on the west coast of Greece, where he planned to spend the winter (*Ti 3:12*). Most likely it was from Nicopolis, or else later from Rome (where the apostle was imprisoned again and eventually martyred), that Paul sent Titus on the mission to Dalmatia, a Roman province in what is now Yugoslavia (see*2 Tm 4:10*). If later tradition is correct, Titus returned to Crete, where he served as bishop until he was an old man.\n\n*See also**Titus, Letter to*.\n\n2. Variant spelling of a gentile proselyte in Corinth, to whose house Paul went after the Jewish community in general rejected his message (*Acts 18:7*).

Wisdom	WISDOM\n\nThe ability to direct one’s mind toward a full understanding of human life and toward its moral fulfillment. Wisdom is thus a special capacity, necessary for full human living; it can be acquired through education and the application of the mind.\n\nDivine Wisdom\n\nAlthough the term “wisdom” is used primarily in the OT with reference to human beings, all wisdom is ultimately rooted and grounded in God. Wisdom forms a central part of the nature of God. In wisdom God created the universe (*Prv 3:19*) and human beings (*Ps 104:24*). Thus wisdom, in its positive connotations, is something inherent in God, reflected in creation, and a part of the reason for human existence.\n\nWisdom in creation is reflected in the form and order that emerged out of primeval chaos. The wisdom of God expressed in the creation of humanity means that human life may also be marked by form and order, and that meaning in life may be found in the created world, which contains marks of divine wisdom. The wisdom of God is creative, purposeful, and good; it is not merely the intellectual activity of God. The potential for human wisdom is rooted in the creation of mankind. Created by divine wisdom, human beings have within them the God-given capacity for wisdom. Thus, it is impossible to understand human wisdom without first grasping its necessary antecedent, divine wisdom.\n\nHuman Wisdom\n\nThe word “wisdom,” with reference to human beings, is used in a variety of different ways in the OT. The word is often used as virtually synonymous with the term “knowledge,” but in its general and secular uses it commonly indicates applied knowledge, skill, or even cunning. Wisdom could be defined as either “superior mental capacity” or “superior skill.” Thus, wisdom is used to describe both the cunning of King Solomon (*1 Kgs 2:1-6*) and the skill of the craftsman Bezalel (*Ex 35:33*). But it was also used to describe mental capacities and skills that had a moral component—the capacity to understand and to do good. Thus, when Moses delegated some of his authority to newly appointed judges, he chose men who were wise, understanding, and experienced (*Dt 1:13*). Such men were considered the wise men in ancient Israel. Human wisdom, in this special sense, was not merely a gift from God, inherent at birth; it had to be developed consciously during a life lived in relationship with God.\n\nThus this positive and special kind of wisdom in human beings cannot be understood apart from God. A frequent theme of the Wisdom Literature in the OT is that the “fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom” (*Prv 9:10*; see also*Jb 28:28*;*Ps 111:10*;*Prv 1:7*;*15:33*). In several ways, this theme sets a perspective for understanding true human wisdom.\n\nFirst, human wisdom is possible only because of the divine wisdom present in creation; the potential for wisdom exists only because God created it. Second, if wisdom is to be developed in a human being, the starting point must be God—specifically, one must revere or fear God. This Hebraic concept of wisdom is strikingly different from the Greek concept. The Ionian philosophers, with remarkable power, developed a system of thought that began without the assumption of the existence of deity. They attempted to develop wisdom through human reason alone. But Hebrew wisdom, though it sought to develop both the reason and the intellect as did the Greeks, could start only with God. The mind and its capacities were God-given; thus, however secular in appearance the wisdom of the Hebrews might seem, it had God as its starting point. The reverence of God—namely the acknowledgment that God existed, created, and was important in human life—lay behind all the developments of Hebrew wisdom.\n\nHuman wisdom, in the Hebrew conception, is thus a development of the mind, an expansion of knowledge, and an understanding of both the meaning of life and how that life must be lived. It is thoroughly intellectual but has a powerful moral result. Wisdom was sought not for its own sake but always for its application to the meaning of life, because life—like wisdom—was God’s gift. This emphasis in Hebrew wisdom meant that the virtues of the wise man or woman were never described in intellectual terms alone. The wise are not the intelligentsia of Israelite society, but as the book of Proverbs makes clear, they were those whose lives were characterized by understanding, patience, diligence, trustworthiness, self-control, modesty, and similar virtues. In a word, the wise man was the God-fearing man; his wisdom lay not just in a static attitude of reverence but rather in the conscious development of the mind toward wisdom in the context of godly living.\n\nFrom this general conception of wisdom there emerged in ancient Israel a special category of men, the wise men. Though wisdom was not limited to them, they were responsible for the growth and communication of wisdom in Israel. The wise men formed one of three classes of religious personnel. First, there were priests and Levites, whose responsibilities lay primarily within the context of established religion. They were the servants of the temple and the leaders of worship and also had certain responsibilities in the area of religious education. Second, there were the prophets, the spokesmen of God to the people of God. Third, there were the wise men. From a certain perspective, they possessed the most secular task among the three groups. They were involved in a variety of tasks, from governmental administration to moral and secular education. As moral educators, they instructed the young people of their day, not in how to make a living, but in how to live. Something of their curriculum has survived in the book of Proverbs. The books of Job and Ecclesiastes also reflect the thought of the wise men.\n\nWisdom in the New Testament\n\nThe word “wisdom” is used in the NT both of the wisdom of God and the wisdom of humans. The continuation of the OT wisdom tradition is found in the NT’s use of the word in conjunction with God and in the positive connotations of the word in relation to human beings. But the NT also speaks negatively of human wisdom. Thus, Paul described his message as being “not in the plausible words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power” (*1 Cor 2:4*). Purely human wisdom has no ultimate merit of its own, and Paul quotes the OT to demonstrate that God would destroy human wisdom (*1 Cor 1:19*; cf.*Is 29:14*). A clear distinction between good and evil wisdom is provided in the Letter of James (*Jas 3:13-18*). A person whose life reflects jealousy and selfish ambition does not have the true wisdom of God but is earthly-minded and unspiritual. But true wisdom is God-given; this wisdom is “first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits, without uncertainty or insincerity” (v*17*).\n\nAs wisdom was the primary possession of God, so too it was reflected in the life and ministry of Jesus. Jesus, during the years of his growth, reflected in his life the increase of wisdom (*Lk 2:40, 52*), and his opponents, as well as his friends, recognized the wisdom in his teaching (*Mt 13:54*).\n\nSince wisdom is rooted and grounded in God, true and spiritual wisdom is God’s gift. It could be seen in the lives and words of the servants of God such as Stephen (*Acts 6:10*) and Paul (*2 Pt 3:15*). Spiritual wisdom, which provided the knowledge enabling a person to live fully the life given by God, was to be desired for oneself and prayed for in others (*Col 1:9*).\n\nThe most central aspect of wisdom in the NT is in the gospel of the crucified Christ. In his first letter to the Corinthian church, Paul contrasted vividly the positive and negative senses of wisdom in proclaiming the death of Jesus Christ. The world did not know God by their own wisdom (*1 Cor 1:21*); that is, the true revelation of God and his redemption of mankind were not revealed to those who sought such truth through wisdom alone, namely, through the Greek approach to wisdom and philosophy. The gospel was declared in preaching, which was, from a strictly philosophical or wisdom perspective, a kind of foolishness. And yet the gospel of Jesus Christ was both the power of God and the wisdom of God (*1 Cor 1:24*). Jesus, for those who believed, became the ultimate source of that wisdom that could come from God alone (*1 Cor 1:30*).\n\n*See also**Wisdom Literature*.\n\n
