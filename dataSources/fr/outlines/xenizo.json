Some of these might have carried the Christian faith back to the island at that time, but this letter to Titus suggests that the church on Crete had been recently founded as a result of Paul’s mission (see Titus 1:5). The only other mention of Crete in the New Testament comes during Paul’s transfer to Rome as a prisoner (Acts 27:7-21). Paul did not have an opportunity to do active ministry in Crete at that time. Most likely, Paul’s work in Crete began after the events of Acts 28:1-31 (AD 60–62) and before his final Roman imprisonment (probably around AD 64~65)."

Paul’s prayers for the Philippian believers were full of joy. He remained very close friends with them. They were partners with him in spreading the good news about Jesus. One way they did this was by sending Paul gifts of money. The money helped him continue his work as an apostle. God worked in the hearts of the believers. Because of this, God did good thing through them. Paul prayed for them to continue living the way Jesus had taught people to live. Then they would be ready for Jesus’ return."
